abstract = {A weighted average composition is suggestd as the "Best Bulk Silicate Earth" (BBSE). BBSE, thought to represent Earth's primitive mantle (modern mantle + crust), is a concept based on analyses of oceanic theoleiites and continental flood basalts, oceanic and continental alkali basalts, ultramafic ophiolites, Archean komatiites, and spinel- and garnet-bearing xenoliths from basalts and kimberlites. BBSE shows the combined effects of core formation and volatility, presumably including condensation and sublimation in the solar nebula and volatile loss during the accretion and early evolution of Earth. The abundances of volatile lithophile elements show a volatility trend (VT) when plotted against condensation temperature. The slope of VT suggests that Earth accreted matter that had condensed over a wide range of temperatures, consistent with planet-formation scenarios of G. W. Wetherill (1988, Mercury, pp. 670-691, Univ. of Arizona Press, Tucson; 1990, Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 18, 205-256). Using VT, BBSE, and long-standing seismic constraints, we infer the composition of the entire Earth and its core. The bulk Earth's VT closely resembles the average composition of H-chondrites (H3-H6). The 10 most abundant elements in the core nominally include ∼85.55 mass{\%} Fe, 5.18{\%} O, 4.88{\%} Ni, 2.69{\%} S, 0.45{\%} Cr, 0.41{\%} Mn, 0.35{\%} P, 0.22{\%} Co, 0.07{\%} Cl, and possibly 0.02{\%} K. The core may contain most of Earth's heavy alkali and halogen elements, in addition to chalcophiles and siderophiles; alternatively, depletions of alkali halide components in BBSE may have resulted from impact blow-off of an early saline ocean. It is unclear whether the core contains a significant fraction of Earth's K and Pb. Possible partitioning of substantial quantities of O, Rb, and Cs into the core and the partitioning behavior of fourth-period transition metals suggests that metal-silicate equilibration occurred at characteristic pressures of several hundred kilobars or more; if correct, this implies core formation during or after accretion of Earth rather than during the planetesimal stage. The inferred partitioning between core and primitive mantle reflects periodic elemental properties, such as covalent radius; elements that possess covalent radii similar to those of iron are most strongly partitioned into the core. The periodic nature of inferred core/mantle partioning conflicts with models involving simple addition of siderophile elements and volatiles in a late chondritic veneer; however, this aspect is in accord with conceptual models involving an approach toward equilibrium partitioning during core formation. In one model, equilibrium melting and segregation of metal occurs continuously over a range of interior pressures and temperatures as fresh material accretes and mixes into Earth. BBSE may reflect retention of a small amount of the last dregs of metal whose composition was controlled by this "dynamic equilibrium."},

abstract = {The observed lifetimes of gaseous protoplanetary discs place strong constraints on gas and ice giant formation in the core accretion scenario. The approximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the gaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc is completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions between km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this timescale constraint, especially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are detected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we numerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles loosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses ranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test different particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our analytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one set by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and the other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere. In the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass, while in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass. We discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant cores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core accretion timescale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in the midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive planetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth timescale is shortened by a factor 30-1000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100-10 000 at 50 AU, compared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively, low-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals.},

abstract = {The formation of Earth's core left behind geophysical and geochemical signatures in both the core and mantle that remain to this day. Seismology requires that the core be lighter than pure iron and therefore must contain light elements, and the geochemistry of mantle-derived rocks reveals extensive siderophile element depletion and fractionation. Both features are inherited from metal-silicate differentiation in primitive Earth and depend upon the nature of physiochemical conditions that prevailed during core formation. To date, core formation models have only attempted to address the evolution of core and mantle compositional signatures separately, rather than seeking a joint solution. Here we combine experimental petrology, geochemistry, mineral physics and seismology to constrain a range of core formation conditions that satisfy both constraints. We find that core formation occurred in a hot (liquidus) yet moderately deep magma ocean not exceeding 1,800 km depth, under redox conditions more oxidized than present-day Earth. This new scenario, at odds with the current belief that core formation occurred under reducing conditions, proposes that Earth's magma ocean started oxidized and has become reduced through time, by oxygen incorporation into the core. This core formation model produces a core that contains 2.7-5{\%} oxygen along with 2-3.6{\%} silicon, with densities and velocities in accord with radial seismic models, and leaves behind a silicate mantle that matches the observed mantle abundances of nickel, cobalt, chromium, and vanadium.},

abstract = {The irregular satellites of the outer planets, whose population now numbers over 100, are likely to have been captured from heliocentric orbit during the early period of solar system history. They may thus constitute an intact sample of the planetesimals that accreted to form the cores of the jovian planets. Ranging in diameter from {\~{}}2 km to over 300 km, these bodies overlap the lower end of the presently known population of transneptunian objects (TNOs). Their size distributions, however, appear to be significantly shallower than that of TNOs of comparable size, suggesting either collisional evolution or a size-dependent capture probability. Several tight orbital groupings at Jupiter, supported by similarities in color, attest to a common origin followed by collisional disruption, akin to that of asteroid families. But with the limited data available to date, this does not appear to be the case at Uranus or Neptune, while the situation at Saturn is unclear. Very limited spectral evidence suggests an origin of the jovian irregulars in the outer asteroid belt, but Saturn's Phoebe and Neptune's Nereid have surfaces dominated by water ice, suggesting an outer solar system origin. The short-term dynamics of many of the irregular satellites are dominated by large-amplitude coupled oscillations in eccentricity and inclination and offer several novel features, including secular resonances. Overall, the orbital distributions of the irregulars seem to be controlled by their long-term stability against solar and planetary perturbations. The details of the process(es) whereby the irregular satellites were captured remain enigmatic, despite significant progress in recent years. Earlier ideas of accidental disruptive collisions within Jupiter's Hill sphere or aerodynamic capture within a circumplanetary nebula have been found wanting and have largely given way to more exotic theories involving planetary migration and/or close encounters between the outer planets. With the Cassini flyby of Phoebe in June 2004, which revealed a complex, volatile-rich surface and a bulk density similar to that of Pluto, we may have had our first closeup look at an average-sized Kuiper belt object.},

abstract = {A multi-phase analysis using long-period World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network and Canadian Network data has been conducted using core-phases for deep focus events from the southwest Pacific. These include SKS, S2KS, SVdiff, and SPdKS. The last phase emerges from SKS near 106° and is associated with a P-wave diffracting along the bottom of the mantle. Patterns in S2KS - SKS differential travel times (TS2KS - SKS) correlate with those in SPdKS - SKS (TSPdKS - SKS). TS2KS - SKSvalues strongly depend on variations in VSstructure in the lower third of the mantle, whereas TSPdKS - SKSvalues mainly depend on VPstructure and variations in a thin zone (100 km or less) at the very base of the mantle. Anomalously large TS2KS - SKSand TSPdKS - SKSvalues (relative to the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM)) are present for Fiji-Tonga and Kermadec events (recorded in North and South America), along with anomalously large SVdiffamplitudes well into the core's shadow. More northerly paths beneath the Pacific to North America for Indonesian and Solomon events display both PREM-like and anomalous times. A model compatible with the observations is presented, and contains a thin very-low-velocity layer at the base of the mantle that underlies the large volumetric lower-mantle low-velocity regions in the southwest Pacific. A low-velocity layer of 20-100 km thickness with reductions of up to 5-10{\%} (relative to PREM) can reproduce TSPdKS - SKSas well as SVdiffamplitudes. Large-scale (more than 1000 km) lower-mantle VSheterogeneity (2-4{\%}) can explain long-wavelength trends in TS2KS - SKS. The exact thickness and velocity reduction in the basal layer is uncertain, owing to difficulties in resolving whether anomalous structure occurs on the source- and/or receiver-side of wavepaths (at the CMB). {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The buoyancy number, or chemical density anomaly, largely dictates ULVZ shape, and the prescribed initial thickness (proxy for volume) of the chemically-distinct layer controls its size. We synthesize our dynamic results with a Voigt-Reuss-Hill mixing model to provide insight into the inherent seismic tradeoff between ULVZ thickness and wavespeed reduction.

Complementary bulk silicate Earth domains (i.e., continental crust $\kappa$PbCC=3.95−0.13+0.19 and modern mantle $\kappa$PbMM=3.87−0.07+0.15) tightly bracket the solar system initial $\kappa$PbSS=3.890±0.015.

We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the $\kappa$Pb of the BSE and bulk Earth for a range of U concentrations in the core (from 0 to 10 ng/g). Comparison of our results with $\kappa$PbSS constrains the available U and Th budget in the core.

abstract = {The tungsten isotope composition of meteorites indicates that core formation in planetesimals occurred within a few million years of Solar System formation. But core formation requires a mechanism for segregating metal, and the 'wetting' properties of molten iron alloy in an olivine-rich matrix is thought to preclude segregation by permeable flow unless the silicate itself is partially molten. Excess liquid metal over a percolation threshold, however, can potentially create permeability in a solid matrix, thereby permitting segregation. Here we report the percolation threshold for molten iron-sulphur compounds of approximately 5 vol.{\%} in solid olivine, based on electrical conductivity measurements made in situ at high pressure and temperature. We conclude that heating within planetesimals by decay of short-lived radionuclides can increase temperature sufficiently above the iron-sulphur melting point (approximately 1,000 degrees C) to trigger segregation of iron alloy by permeable flow within the short timeframe indicated by tungsten isotopes. We infer that planetesimals with radii greater than about 30 km and larger planetary embryos are expected to have formed cores very early, and these objects would have contained much of the mass in the terrestrial region of the protoplanetary nebula. The Earth and other terrestrial planets are likely therefore to have formed by accretion of previously differentiated planetesimals, and Earth's core may accordingly be viewed as a blended composite of pre-formed cores.},

abstract = {Turbulent convection of the liquid iron alloy outer core generates Earth's magnetic field and supplies heat to the mantle. The exact composition of the iron alloy is fundamentally linked to the processes powering the convection and can be constrained by its seismic properties. Discrepancies between seismic models determined using body waves and normal modes show that these properties are not yet fully agreed upon. In addition, technical challenges in experimentally measuring the equation-of-state (EoS) parameters of liquid iron alloys at high pressures and temperatures further complicate compositional inferences. We directly infer EoS parameters describing Earth's outer core from normal mode center frequency observations and present the resulting Elastic Parameters of the Outer Core (EPOC) seismic model. Unlike alternative seismic models, ours requires only three parameters and guarantees physically realistic behavior with increasing pressure for a well-mixed homogeneous material along an isentrope, consistent with the outer core's condition. We show that EPOC predicts available normal mode frequencies better than the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) while also being more consistent with body wave–derived models, eliminating a long-standing discrepancy. The velocity at the top of the outer core is lower, and increases with depth more steeply, in EPOC than in PREM, while the density in EPOC is higher than that in PREM across the outer core. The steeper profiles and higher density imply that the outer core comprises a lighter but more compressible alloy than that inferred for PREM. Furthermore, EPOC's steeper velocity gradient explains differential SmKS body wave travel times better than previous one-dimensional global models, without requiring an anomalously slow {\~{}}90- to 450-km-thick layer at the top of the outer core.},

abstract = {The first indisputable evidence for very early differentiation of the silicate Earth came from the extinct (146)Sm-(142)Nd chronometer. (142)Nd excesses measured in 3.7-billion-year (Gyr)-old rocks from Isua (southwest Greenland) relative to modern terrestrial samples imply their derivation from a depleted mantle formed in the Hadean eon (about 4,570-4,000 Gyr ago). As dictated by mass balance, the differentiation event responsible for the formation of the Isua early-depleted reservoir must also have formed a complementary enriched component. However, considerable efforts to find early-enriched mantle components in Isua have so far been unsuccessful. Here we show that the signature of the Hadean enriched reservoir, complementary to the depleted reservoir in Isua, is recorded in 3.4-Gyr-old mafic dykes intruding into the Early Archaean rocks. Five out of seven dykes carry (142)Nd deficits compared to the terrestrial Nd standard, with three samples yielding resolvable deficits down to -10.6 parts per million. The enriched component that we report here could have been a mantle reservoir that differentiated owing to the crystallization of a magma ocean, or could represent a mafic proto-crust that separated from the mantle more than 4.47 Gyr ago. Our results testify to the existence of an enriched component in the Hadean, and may suggest that the southwest Greenland mantle preserved early-formed heterogeneities until at least 3.4 Gyr ago.},

abstract = {Anorthosites that comprise the bulk of the lunar crust are believed to have formed during solidification of a Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) in which these rocks would have floated to the surface. This early flotation crust would have formed a thermal blanket over the remaining LMO, prolonging solidification. Geochronology of lunar anorthosites indicates a long timescale of LMO cooling, or re-melting and re-crystallization in one or more late events. To better interpret this geochronology, we model LMO solidification in a scenario where the Moon is being continuously bombarded by returning projectiles released from the Moon-forming giant impact. More than one lunar mass of material escaped the Earth-Moon system onto heliocentric orbits following the giant impact, much of it to come back on returning orbits for a period of 100 Myr. If large enough, these projectiles would have punctured holes in the nascent floatation crust of the Moon, exposing the LMO to space and causing more rapid cooling. We model these scenarios using a thermal evolution model of the Moon that allows for production (by cratering) and evolution (solidification and infill) of holes in the flotation crust that insulates the LMO. For effective hole production, solidification of the magma ocean can be significantly expedited, decreasing the cooling time by more than a factor of 5. If hole production is inefficient, but shock conversion of projectile kinetic energy to thermal energy is efficient, then LMO solidification can be somewhat prolonged, lengthening the cooling time by 50{\%} or more.},

abstract = {After the Moon's formation, Earth experienced a protracted bombardment by leftover planetesimals. The mass delivered during this stage of late accretion has been estimated to be approximately 0.5{\%} of Earth's present mass, based on highly siderophile element concentrations in the Earth's mantle and the assumption that all highly siderophile elements delivered by impacts were retained in the mantle. However, late accretion may have involved mostly large (≥ 1,500 km in diameter)—and therefore differentiated—projectiles in which highly siderophile elements were sequestered primarily in metallic cores. Here we present smoothed-particle hydrodynamics impact simulations that show that substantial portions of a large planetesimal's core may descend to the Earth's core or escape accretion entirely. Both outcomes reduce the delivery of highly siderophile elements to the Earth's mantle and imply a late accretion mass that may be two to five times greater than previously thought. Further, we demonstrate that projectile material can be concentrated within localized domains of Earth's mantle, producing both positive and negative 182W isotopic anomalies of the order of 10 to 100 ppm. In this scenario, some isotopic anomalies observed in terrestrial rocks can be explained as products of collisions after Moon formation.},

abstract = {The rate at which heat is extracted across the core mantle boundary (CMB) is constrained by the requirement of dynamo action in the core. This constraint can be computed explicitly using the entropy balance of the core and depends on the thermal conductivity, whose value has been revised upwardly. A high order model (fourth degree polynomial of the radial position) for the core structure is derived and the implications for the core cooling rate and thermal evolution obtained, using the recent values of the thermal conductivity. For a thermal conductivity increasing with depth as proposed by some of these recent studies, a CMB heat flow equal to the isentropic value (13.25. TW at present) leads to a 700. km thick layer at the top of the core where a downward convective heat flow is necessary to maintain an isentropic and well mixed average state. Considering a CMB heat flow larger than the well mixed isentropic value leads to an inner core less than 700. Myr old and the thermal evolution of the core is largely constrained by the conditions for dynamo action without an inner core. Analytical calculations for that period show that a CMB temperature larger than 7000. K must have prevailed 4.5. Gyr ago if the geodynamo has been driven by thermal convection for that whole time. This raises questions regarding the onset of the geodynamo and its continuous operation for the last 3.5. Gyr. Implications regarding the evolution of a basal magma ocean are also considered.},

Tides raised on the earth by the moon have caused an expansion of the lunar orbit. Tides raised on the moon by the earth have de-spun the moon to synchronous rotation and driven its spin axis to a Cassini state-that is, in a coprecessing configuration, coplanar with the lunar orbit normal and the normal to the Laplacian plane (which is at present coincident with the normal to the ecliptic). This combination of events has resulted in a complex history for the lunar spin axis. For much of the period during which its orbital semimajor axis expanded between 30 and 40 earth radii, the obliquity of the moon was of order 25 degrees to 50 degrees . In fact, for a brief period the obliquity periodically attained a value as high as 77 degrees ; that is, the spin axis of the moon was only 13 degrees from lying in its orbit plane.},

abstract = {The Earth-Moon system is suggested to have formed through a single giant collision, in which the Moon accreted from the impact-generated debris disk. However, such giant impacts are rare, and during its evolution the Earth experienced many more smaller impacts, producing smaller satellites that potentially coevolved. In the multiple-impact hypothesis of lunar formation, the current Moon was produced from the mergers of several smaller satellites (moonlets), each formed from debris disks produced by successive large impacts. In the Myrs between impacts, a pre-existing moonlet tidally evolves outward until a subsequent impact forms a new moonlet, at which point both moonlets will tidally evolve until a merger or system disruption. In this work, we examine the likelihood that pre-existing moonlets survive subsequent impact events, and explore the dynamics of Earth-moonlet systems that contain two moonlets generated Myrs apart. We demonstrate that pre-existing moonlets can tidally migrate outward, remain stable during subsequent impacts, and later merge with newly created moonlets (or re-collide with the Earth). Formation of the Moon from the mergers of several moonlets could therefore be a natural byproduct of the Earth's growth through multiple impacts. More generally, we examine the likelihood and consequences of Earth having prior moons, and find that the stability of moonlets against disruption by subsequent impacts implies that several large impacts could post-date Moon formation.},

abstract = {We investigated the melting properties of a synthetic chondritic primitive mantle up to core–mantle boundary (CMB) pressures, using laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Melting criteria are essentially based on the use of X-rays provided by synchrotron radiation. We report a solidus melting curve lower than previously determined using optical methods. The liquidus curve is found between 300 and 600K higher than the solidus over the entire lower mantle. At CMB pressures (135GPa), the chondritic mantle solidus and liquidus reach 4150 (±150) K and 4725 (±150) K, respectively. We discuss that the lower mantle is unlikely to melt in the D″-layer, except if the highest estimate of the temperature profile at the base of the mantle, which is associated with a very hot core, is confirmed. Therefore, recent suggestions of partial melting in the lowermost mantle based on seismic observations of ultra-low velocity zones indicate either (1) a outer core exceeding 4150K at the CMB or (2) the presence of chemical heterogeneities with high concentration of fusible elements. Our observations of a high liquidus temperature as well as a large gap between solidus and liquidus temperatures have important implications for the properties of the magma ocean during accretion. Not only complete melting of the lower mantle would require excessively high temperatures, but also, below liquidus temperatures partial melting should take place over a much larger depth interval than previously thought. In addition, magma adiabats suggest very high surface temperatures in case of a magma ocean that would extend to more than 40GPa, as suggested by siderophile metal–silicate partitioning data. Such high surface temperature regime, where thermal blanketing is inefficient, points out to a transient character of the magma ocean, with a very fast cooling rate.},

abstract = {Dynamical models of planet formation coupled with cosmochemical data from martian meteorites show that Mars' isotopic composition is distinct from that of Earth. Reconciliation of formation models with meteorite data require that Mars grew further from the Sun than its present position. Here, we evaluate this compositional difference in more detail by comparing output from two {\$}N{\$}-body planet formation models. The first of these planet formation models simulates what is termed the "Classical" case wherein Jupiter and Saturn are kept in their current orbits. We compare these results with another model based on the "Grand Tack", in which Jupiter and Saturn migrate through the primordial asteroid belt. Our estimate of the average fraction of chondrite assembled into Earth and Mars assumes that the initial solid disk consists of only sources of enstatite chondrite composition in the inner region, and ordinary chondrite in the outer region. Results of these analyses show that both models tend to yield Earth and Mars analogues whose accretion zones overlap. The Classical case fares better in forming Mars with its documented composition (29{\%} to 68{\%} enstatite chondrite plus 32{\%} to 67{\%} ordinary chondrite) though the Mars analogues are generally too massive. However, if we include the restriction of mass on the Mars analogues, the Classical model does not work better. We also further calculate the isotopic composition of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}17{\}} \backslashrm O{\$}, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}50{\}} \backslashrm Ti{\$}, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}54{\}} \backslashrm Cr{\$}, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}142{\}} \backslashrm Nd{\$}, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}64{\}} \backslashrm Ni{\$}, and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}92{\}} \backslashrm Mo{\$} in the martian mantle from the Grand Tack simulations. We find that it is possible to match the calculated isotopic composition of all the above elements in Mars' mantle with their measured values, but the resulting uncertainties are too large to place good restriction on the early dynamical evolution and birth place of Mars.},

Based on observation of grain flattening, optical strain features, shapes and densities of dislocation arrays, and flow law parameters, samples deformed dominantly by dislocation creep, with some contribution from grain-boundary sliding. Bearing in mind possible changes in the flow law parameters over the extrapolation interval and possible effects of the $\alpha$ - $\beta$ phase transition, extrapolation to natural strain rates and temperatures predicts plastic flow at higher flow stresses at the same water fugacity at greenschist facies temperatures than previously published flow laws. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To gain insight into the rheology of selected feldspar-bearing rocks from the continental lower crust (CLC), three granulites from exposed lower crustal terrains and a microgabbro have been deformed to ca. {\~{}}10{\%} strain at confining pressures of 0.8-1.0 GPa, temperatures of 600-900°C, and constant strain-rates of 10-4-10-7s-1. The most extensive work was done on the mafic Pikwitonei and felsic Adirondack granulites. The Pikwitonei (Mg-hornblende-plag (An70-2 px) has only a limited T,$\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} range of apparent steady-state behavior, and strain-softens at T ≥ 800°C at $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} = 10-5-10-6s-1, apparently associated with developing shear zones. This strain-softening is pressure-insensitive from Pc= 0.8-1.0 GPa at T = 850°C, $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} = 10-6s-1even though the dominant strain accommodation mechanisms change from semibrittle/cataclastic to crystal plastic (including dynamic recrystallization) with increasing pressure. Plagioclase appears to bear more of the creep strain than amphibole at most experimental conditions except in those runs where both plagioclase and amphibole recrystallization occurs. Kapuskasing (plag-cpx-gt) granulite, deformed at 800°C and at 850°C, 10-6s-1has deformed in the steady-state at stress levels only slightly greater than the Pikwitonei. The Stillwater microgabbro and Adirondack granulite are appreciably weaker and the latter exhibits homogeneous semibrittle steady-state behavior over the entire range of conditions investigated. For the Adirondack (2 felds-2 px-gt-qtz) granulite, quartz (21{\%}) appears to control the creep rate at these low strains, and steady-state mechanical data fit well a creep power law with A = 8 × 10-3MPa-ns-1, Qc= 243 kJ/mol and n = 3.1. Extrapolation of this flow law and of preliminary power law creep relations for the Pikwitonei and microgabbro to a range of physical conditions assumed to encompass those at the continental Moho supports geological and geophysical inferences that a mechanical discontinuity occurs at this transition zone, with the lower crust generally being the weaker material. In addition, the stain-softening exhibited by the Pikwitonei may bear directly on the development of detachment zones at mid- to lower-crustal depths during prograde metamorphism. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Rock-mechanics experiments, geodetic observations of postloading strain transients, and micro- and macrostructural studies of exhumed ductile shear zones provide complementary views of the style and rheology of deformation deep in Earth's crust and upper mantle. Overall, results obtained in small-scale laboratory experiments provide robust constraints on deformation mechanisms and viscosities at the natural laboratory conditions. Geodetic inferences of the viscous strength of the upper mantle are consistent with flow of mantle rocks at temperatures and water contents determined from surface heat-flow, seismic, and mantle xenolith studies. Laboratory results show that deformation mechanisms and rheology strongly vary as a function of stress, grain size, and fluids. Field studies reveal a strong tendency for deformation in the lower crust and uppermost mantle in and adjacent to fault zones to localize into systems of discrete shear zones with strongly reduced grain size and strength. Deformation mechanisms and rheology may vary over short spatial (shear zone) and temporal (earthquake cycle) scales.

abstract = {It has been agreed for nearly a century that a strong, load-bearing outer layer of earth is required to support mountain ranges, transmit stresses to deform active regions, and store elastic strain to generate earthquakes. However, the depth and extent of this strong layer remain controversial. Here we use a variety of observations to infer the distribution of lithospheric strength in the active western United States from seismic to steady-state time scales. We use evidence from post-seismic transient and earthquake cycle deformation, reservoir loading, glacioisostatic adjustment, and lithosphere isostatic adjustment to large surface and subsurface loads. The nearly perfectly elastic behavior of Earth{\&}{\#}39;s crust and mantle at the time scale of seismic wave propagation evolves to that of a strong, elastic crust and weak, ductile upper mantle lithosphere at both earthquake cycle (EC, {\~{}}100 to 103 yr) and glacioisostatic adjustment (GIA, {\~{}}103 to 104 yr) time scales. Topography and gravity field correlations indicate that lithosphere isostatic adjustment (LIA) on {\~{}}106{\&}{\#}8211;107 yr time scales occurs with most lithospheric stress supported by an upper crust overlying a much weaker ductile substrate. These comparisons suggest that the upper mantle lithosphere is weaker than the crust at all time scales longer than seismic. In contrast, the lower crust has a chameleon-like behavior, strong at EC and GIA time scales and weak for LIA and steady-state deformation processes. The lower crust might even take on a third identity in regions of rapid crustal extension or continental collision, where anomalously high temperatures may lead to large-scale ductile flow in a lower crustal layer that is locally weaker than the upper mantle. Modeling of lithospheric processes in active regions thus cannot use a one-size-fits-all prescription of rheological layering (relation between applied stress and deformation as a function of depth) but must be tailored to the time scale and tectonic setting of the process being investigated.},

abstract = {[1] To specify quantitatively the effect of pressure and water weakening on the flow strength of feldspar we performed triaxial creep experiments in a gas deformation apparatus at temperatures of 1000 - 1150 degrees C, confining pressures of 100 - 450 MPa, and axial stresses of 10 - 400 MPa, resulting in strain rates of similar to 6 x 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-3) s(-1). Dense samples with a grain size of similar to 3 mu m were prepared by hot-isostatic pressing of anorthite glass powder. Hydrous samples contain about 0.33 +/- 0.14 wt {\%} H2O and dry specimens 0.0005 - 0.02 wt {\%} H2O. The estimated residual glass content of wet samples is {\textless} 2 vol {\%}. Samples deformed by grain boundary diffusion-controlled creep at low stresses and dislocation creep at stresses greater than or similar to 150 MPa. We estimate an activation volume of V approximate to 24 cm(3) mol(-1) for anhydrous samples deforming in diffusion creep. For wet samples, deformed in hydrous conditions with varying buffers fixing oxygen fugacity, the activation volume is about 38 cm(3) mol(-1). Creep rate of hydrous anorthite aggregates depends on water fugacity raised to a power of r = 1.0 +/- 0.3, suggesting hydrolysis of oxygen bonds. Considering the effect of activation volume and water fugacity on extrapolation of constitutive laws to conditions prevailing in the continental lower crust, viscosities of hydrous feldspar aggregates increase by a factor of {\textless} 3.},

abstract = {Using state-of-the-art ab-initio computations, we find that pressure and chemical environment have a small effect on the electron-capture component of the decay constants of isotopes of 7Be, 22Na and 40K. As expected, 7Be shows the greatest amount of change with {\~{}}0.1–0.2{\%} increase in the decay constant at 25 GPa as a metal, chloride or oxide. In their metallic forms, 22Na and 40K show an increase of 0.06{\%} and 0.025{\%} change, respectively, at 25 GPa. Upon further compression, potassium and sodium undergo an s-to-d electronic transition of their valence electron, causing a significant change in the charge density at the nucleus. Our results suggest that the effect of pressure and chemistry on 40K, combined with the opposing effects of high temperatures, will have little, discernible effect on the heat production in the deep Earth as our predicted changes are smaller than the uncertainties in the total decay constant for 40K.},

In this review, we discuss the influence of deformation on melt-extraction processes, with an emphasis on the understanding gained from a wide range of laboratory experimental investigations. Rheological properties of partially molten rocks are very sensitive to melt distribution, and melt distribution is profoundly influenced by deviatoric stress in a viscously deforming partially molten rock, establishing a coupling between deformation and melt distribution. During deformation, this coupling can lead to organization of melt into melt-enriched shear zones at length scales longer than the grain size. We discuss the current state of understanding of this process, with some speculation on its role in the ensemble of processes that constitute melt extraction from the Earth.},

Ambient pressure density measurements on these and other Fe-bearing silicate liquids indicate that FeO has a partial molar volume that is highly dependent on composition, which leads to large errors in estimates of the densities of Fe-bearing liquids at ambient pressure based on an ideal mixing of any fixed set of end-member liquids. We formulated a series of mixing tests using the EOS determined in this study to examine whether ideal mixing of volumes might nevertheless suffice to describe the ternary system CaAl2Si2O8-CaFeSi2O6-CaMgSi2O6 at high temperature and pressure. The ideal mixing null hypothesis is rejected; compositional variations in partial molar volume of FeO appear to extend to high pressure. Only densities of Fe-bearing liquid mixtures with oxide mole fraction of FeO less than 0.06 can be adequately approximated using an ideal solution.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {A thermodynamic model for estimating the saturation conditions of H 2 O–CO 2 mixed fluids in multi - component silicate liquids is described. The model extends the capabilities of rhyolite-MELTS (Gualda et al. in J Pet - rol 53:875–890, 2012a ) and augments the water saturation model in MELTS (Ghiorso and Sack in Contrib Mineral Petrol 119:197–212, 1995 ). The model is internally con - sistent with the fluid-phase thermodynamic model of Duan and Zhang (Geochim Cosmochim Acta 70:2311–2324, 2006 ). It may be used independently of rhyolite-MELTS to estimate intensive variables and fluid saturation conditions from glass inclusions trapped in phenocrysts. The model is calibrated from published experimental data on water and carbon dioxide solubility, and mixed fluid saturation in sili - cate liquids. The model is constructed on the assumption that water dissolves to form a hydroxyl melt species, and that carbon dioxide both a molecular species and a carbon - ate ion, the latter complexed with calcium. Excess enthalpy interaction terms in part compensate for these simplistic assumptions regarding speciation. The model is restricted to natural composition liquids over the pressure range 0–3 GPa. One characteristic of the model is that fluid saturation isobars at pressures greater than {\~{}}100 MPa always display a maximum in melt CO 2 at nonzero H 2 O melt concentra - tions, regardless of bulk composition. This feature is uni - versal and can be attributed to the dominance of hydroxyl speciation at low water concentrations. The model is applied to four examples. The first involves estimation of pressures from H 2 O–CO 2 -bearing glass inclusions found in quartz phenocrysts of the Bishop Tuff. The second illus - trates H 2 O and CO 2 partitioning between melt and fluid during fluid-saturated equilibrium and fractional crystalli - zation of MORB. The third example demonstrates that the position of the quartz–feldspar cotectic surface is insensi - tive to melt CO 2 contents, which facilitates geobarometry using phase equilibria. The final example shows the effect of H 2 O and CO 2 on the crystallization paths of a high-sil - ica rhyolite composition representative of the late-erupted Bishop Tuff. Software that implements the model is availa - ble at ofm-research.org, and the model is incorporated into the latest version (1.1 + ) of rhyolite-MELTS.},

abstract = {Silicic magma systems are of great scientific interest and societal importance owing to their role in the evolution of the crust and the hazards posed by volcanic eruptions. MELTS is a powerful and widely used tool to study the evolution of magmatic systems over a wide spectrum of compositions and conditions. However, the current calibration of MELTS fails to correctly predict the position of the quartz + feldspar saturation surface in temperature, pressure and composition space, making it unsuitable to study silicic systems. We create a modified calibration of MELTS optimized for silicic systems, dubbed rhyolite-MELTS, using early erupted Bishop pumice as a reference. Small adjustments to the calorimetrically determined enthalpy of formation of quartz and of the potassium end-member of alkali feldspar in the MELTS calibration lead to much improved predictions of the quartz + feldspar saturation surface as a function of pressure. Application of rhyolite-MELTS to the Highland Range Volcanic Sequence (Nevada), the Peach Spring Tuff (Arizona–Nevada–California), and the late-erupted Bishop Tuff (California), using compositions that vary from trachydacite to high-silica rhyolite, shows that the calibration is appropriate for a variety of fluid-bearing silicic systems. Some key observations include the following. (1) The simulated evolutionary paths are consistent with petrographic observations and glass compositions; further work is needed to compare predicted and observed mineral compositions. (2) The nearly invariant nature of silicic magmas is well captured by rhyolite-MELTS; unusual behavior is observed after extensive pseudo-invariant crystallization, suggesting that the new calibration works best for relatively small (i.e. {\textless}50 wt {\%}) crystallization intervals, comparable with what is observed in volcanic rocks. (3) Our success with rhyolite-MELTS shows that water-bearing systems in which hydrous phases do not play a critical role can be appropriately handled; simulations are sensitive to initial water concentration, and although only a pure-H2O fluid is modeled, suitable amounts of water can be added or subtracted to mimic the effect of CO2 in fluid solubility. Our continuing work on natural systems shows that rhyolite-MELTS is very useful in constraining crystallization conditions, and is particularly well suited to explore the eruptive potential of silicic magmas. We show that constraints placed by rhyolite-MELTS simulations using late-erupted Bishop Tuff whole-rock and melt inclusion compositions are inconsistent with a vertically stratified magma body.},

abstract = {Abstract Crystallization and chemical differentiation of the early Earth were governed by a combination of various processes. Within the uncertainties of physical parameters, the two end-member models, equilibrium crystallization and fractional crystallization, are both possible. In terms of crystal size, the boundary between these models is {\~{}} 1 mm. Analysis of nucleation and crystal growth in the convecting magma ocean suggests that the crystals in the magma ocean are approximately this size. The equilibrium model is preferred because it seems to satisfy better the geochemical constraints. According to this model, at the early stages, crystallization proceeds from bottom up without any substantial crystal–melt segregation. In a vigorously convecting magma ocean, the thermal profile is approximately adiabatic and the crystal fraction decreases gradually with depth. The basic physical reason for equilibrium crystallization is a fast convective cooling during which the solid and the liquid phases had a very limited time window for crystal–melt segregation, about 1000 years. Chemical differentiation due to crystal–melt segregation is more significant at low pressures corresponding – with large uncertainties – to the upper mantle. It is caused by several factors. When the temperature drops below liquidus everywhere, the nucleation–growth–dissolution cycle of crystals changes to continuous crystal growth. This increases the crystal size to {\~{}} 1 cm indicating the beginning of crystal–melt segregation. When the crystal fraction increases to about 60{\%} near the surface, the convective heat transport is controlled by solid-state creep, which is many orders of magnitude slower. Crystal–melt segregation occurs via melt percolation, which is consistent with the geochemical constraints. Crystallization of the remaining partially molten layers takes about 107–109 years. This stage merges with the subsequent planetary evolution controlled by mantle convection and radiogenic heating. The long lifetime of the shallow magma ocean suggests that this might be the place where liquid iron equilibrates with the mantle before it sinks down to the core.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. The energy sources involved in the early stages of the formation of terrestrial bodies can induce partial or even complete melting of the mantle, leading to the emergence of magma oceans. The fractional crystallization of a magma ocean can cause the formation of a compositional layering that can play a fundamental role for the subsequent long-term dynamics of the interior and for the evolution of geochemical reservoirs. In order to assess to what extent primordial compositional heterogeneities generated by magma ocean solidification can be preserved, we investigate the solidification of a whole-mantle Martian magma ocean, and in particular the conditions that allow solid-state convection to start mixing the mantle before solidification is completed. To this end, we performed 2-D numerical simulations in a cylindrical geometry. We treat the liquid magma ocean in a parameterized way while we self-consistently solve the conservation equations of thermochemical convection in the growing solid cumulates accounting for pressure-, temperature-, and, where it applies, melt-dependent viscosity. By testing the effects of different cooling rates and convective vigor, we show that for a lifetime of the liquid magma ocean of 1 Myr or longer, the onset of solid-state convection prior to complete mantle crystallization is likely and that a significant part of the compositional heterogeneities generated by fractionation can be erased by efficient mantle mixing. We discuss the consequences of our findings in relation to the formation and evolution of compositional reservoirs on Mars and on the other terrestrial bodies of the solar system.},

abstract = {Whether early Archaean felsic crust was formed by processes related to plate subduction or melting of thick basaltic plateaus is vividly debated. Ultimately, the discussion hinges on the question of how Archaean felsic crust has obtained its distinct chemical traits. Here we report chemical and isotopic data for a suite of Cenozoic felsic volcanic rocks from Iceland. The samples exhibit the key-chemical characteristics of early Archaean felsic continental crust such as calc-alkaline composition, strong enrichment in Na relative to K, high Pb/Ce, La/Nb, and Ta/Nb ratios. Involvement of pre-existing continental lithosphere in the petrogenesis of the samples can be excluded, because their 207Pb/204Pb and 206Pb/204Pb ratios plot well within the range of Iceland basalts. Model calculations suggest that the chemical characteristics were produced by high-pressure partial melting of basaltic lower crust followed by fractional crystallisation of amphibole, plagioclase, and ilmenite. These findings demonstrate that plate subduction and melting of subduction-modified mantle or lithosphere are not necessarily required to produce the key-chemical signatures of continental crust. Hence, the calc-alkaline dacites provide intriguing support for early Archaean continental crust formation by melting of thick mafic plateaus.},

abstract = {Melt generation and migration are an important link between surface processes and the thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth's interior. However, their vastly different timescales make it difficult to study mantle convection and melt migration in a unified framework, especially for 3-D global models. And although experiments suggest an increase in melt volume of up to 20 per cent from the depth of melt generation to the surface, previous computations have neglected the individual compressibilities of the solid and the fluid phase. Here, we describe our extension of the finite element mantle convection code ASPECT that adds melt generation and migration. We use the original compressible formulation of the McKenzie equations, augmented by an equation for the conservation of energy. Applying adaptive mesh refinement to this type of problems is particularly advantageous, as the resolution can be increased in areas where melt is present and viscosity gradients are high, whereas a lower resolution is sufficient in regions without melt. Together with a high-performance, massively parallel implementation, this allows for high-resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations coupled with melt migration. We evaluate the functionality and potential of this method using a series of benchmarks and model setups, compare results of the compressible and incompressible formulation, and show the effectiveness of adaptive mesh refinement when applied to melt migration. Our model of magma dynamics provides a framework for modelling processes on different scales and investigating links between processes occurring in the deep mantle and melt generation and migration. This approach could prove particularly useful applied to modelling the generation of komatiites or other melts originating in greater depths. The implementation is available in the Open Source ASPECT repository.},

abstract = {Rifted margins mark a transition from continents to oceans and contain in their architecture a record of their rift history. Recent investigations of rift architecture have suggested that multiphase deformation of the crust and mantle lithosphere leads to the formation of distinct margin domains. The processes that control transitions between these domains, however, are not fully understood. Here we use high-resolution numerical simulations to show how structural inheritance and variations in extension velocity control the architecture of rifted margins and their temporal evolution. Distinct domains form as extension velocities increase over time and deformation focuses along lithosphere-scale detachment faults, which migrate oceanwards through re-activation and complex linkages of prior fault networks. Our models demonstrate, in unprecedented detail, how faults formed in the earliest phases of continental extension control the subsequent structural evolution and complex architecture of rifted margins through fault interaction processes, hereby creating the widely observed distinct margin domains. Continental rifting and break up processes are poorly constrained in the early stages. Here, the authors using high-resolution numerical simulations to show how early formed faults in continental extension can then control subsequent structure evolution of rifts.},

abstract = {Passive margins may undergo multiple phases of extension with distinct structural, petrological and sedimentary processes before achieving breakup. Observations of rift axis migration through time may reflect cooling, hardening and subsequent abandonment of the rift axis during either long-term periods of slow extension or periods of tectonic quiescence. Here, we use 2D thermo-mechanical numerical models to examine rift reactivation and migration during multiphase extension where a period of tectonic quiescence separates phases of extension. Our goals are to identify the rheological mechanism(s) controlling rift reactivation versus migration and determine if cooling phases may help explain recent interpretations of passive margin architecture and evolution. Our numerical experiments indicate that the relative integrated brittle strength between the initial rift and surrounding regions, rather than the total integrated strength, largely controls rift reactivation versus migration. The tectonic quiescence (cooling) duration required to induce rift migration ranges between 20 and 60 Myr (minimum bounds). This range reflects variations in extension velocity, magnitude of shear zone healing, crustal rheology and asthenospheric rheology. Reactivated rifts after extensive ({\textgreater}20 Myr) cooling periods in some cases develop asymmetric margins with deformation patterns stepping toward the future rift, such as characterizing most of the Atlantic conjugate margins.},

abstract = {[1] We describe a newly calibrated model for the thermodynamic properties of magmatic silicate liquid. The new model, pMELTS, is based on MELTS [Ghiorso and Sack, 1995] but has a number of improvements aimed at increasing the accuracy of calculations of partial melting of spinel peridotite. The pMELTS algorithm uses models of the thermodynamic properties of minerals and the phase equilibrium algorithms of MELTS, but the model for silicate liquid differs from MELTS in the following ways: (1) The new algorithm is calibrated from an expanded set of mineral-liquid equilibrium constraints from 2439 experiments, 54{\%} more than MELTS. (2) The new calibration includes mineral components not considered during calibration of MELTS and results in 11, 394 individual mineral-liquid calibration constraints (110{\%} more than MELTS). Of these, 4924 statements of equilibrium are from experiments conducted at elevated pressure (200{\%} more than MELTS). (3) The pMELTS model employs an improved liquid equation of state based on a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation, calibrated from high-pressure sink-float and shockwave experiments to 10 GPa. (4) The new model employs a revised set of end-member liquid components. The revised components were chosen to better span liquid composition-space. Thermodynamic properties of these components are optimized as part of the mineral-liquid calibration. Comparison of pMELTS to partial melting relations of spinel peridotite from experiments near 1 GPa indicates significant improvements relative to MELTS, but important outstanding problems remain. The pMELTS model accurately predicts oxide concentrations, including SiO2, for liquids from partial melting of MM3 peridotite at 1 GPa from near the solidus up to similar to25{\%} melting. Compared to experiments, the greatest discrepancy is for MgO, for which the calculations are between 1 and 4{\%} high. Temperatures required to achieve a given melt fraction match those of the experiments near the solidus but are 60 C high over much of the spinel lherzolite melting interval at this pressure. Much of this discrepancy can probably be attributed to overstabilization of clinopyroxene in pMELTS under these conditions. Comparison of pMELTS calculations to the crystallization and partial melting experiments of Falloon et al. [1999] shows excellent agreement but also suffers from exaggerated calculated stability of clinopyroxene. Finally, comparison of pMELTS calculations to the garnet peridotite experiments of Walter [1998] at 3-7 GPa reveals disparities between calculations and experiments that increase with pressure. The most prominent of these disparities is manifest as overprediction of the stability of garnet and underprediction of that of olivine. Part of this problem may be attributed to inadequacies in the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state in reproducing the behavior of highly compressible liquids at high pressures and temperatures.},

abstract = {ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion) is a massively parallel finite element code originally designed for modeling thermal convection in the mantle with a Newtonian rheology. The code is characterized by modern numerical methods, high-performance parallelism and extensibility. This last characteristic is illustrated in this work: we have extended the use of ASPECT from global thermal convection modeling to upper mantle-scale applications of subduction. Subduction modeling generally requires the tracking of multiple materials with different properties and with nonlinear viscous and viscoplastic rheologies. To this end, we implemented a frictional plasticity criterion that is combined with a viscous diffusion and dislocation creep rheology. Because ASPECT uses compositional fields to represent different materials (and, since recently, tracers), all material parameters are made dependent on a user-specified number of fields. The goal of this paper is primarily to describe and validate our implementations of complex, multi-material rheology by reproducing the results of four well-known two-dimensional benchmarks: the indentor benchmark, the brick experiment, the sandbox experiment and the slab detachment benchmark. Furthermore, we aim to provide hands-on examples for prospective users by demonstrating the use of multi-material viscoplasticity with three-dimensional, thermomechanical models of oceanic subduction, putting ASPECT on the map as a community code for high-resolution, nonlinear rheology subduction modeling.},

The effects of increasing the concentration of dissolved H2O on the major element compositions of melts in equilibrium with a spinel lherzolite mineral assemblage are to decrease the concentrations of SiO2, FeO, MgO, and CaO. The concentration of Al2O3 is unaffected. The lower SiO2 contents of the hydrous melts result from an increase in the activity coefficient for SiO2 with increasing dissolved H2O. The lower concentrations of FeO and MgO result from the lower temperatures at which H2O-bearing melts coexist with mantle minerals as compared to anhydrous melts. These compositional changes produce an elevated SiO2/(MgO+FeO) ratio in hydrous peridotite partial melts, making them relatively SiO2 rich when compared to anhydrous melts on a volatile-free basis. Hydrous peridotite melting reactions are affected primarily by the lowered mantle solidus. Temperature-induced compositional variations in coexisting pyroxenes lower the proportion of clinopyroxene entering the melt relative to orthopyroxene. Isobaric batch melting calculations indicate that fluid-undersaturated peridotite melting is characterized by significantly lower melt productivity than anhydrous peridotite melting, and that the peridotite melting process in subduction zones is strongly influenced by the composition of the H2O-rich component introduced into the mantle wedge from the subducted slab.},

abstract = {We have investigated the obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets in habitable zones (at ∼1 AU) in extrasolar planetary systems, due to tidal interactions with their satellite and host star with wide varieties of satellite-to-planet mass ratio (m / Mp) and initial obliquity ($\gamma$0), through numerical calculations and analytical arguments. The obliquity, the angle between planetary spin axis and its orbit normal, of a terrestrial planet is one of the key factors in determining the planetary surface environments. A recent scenario of terrestrial planet accretion implies that giant impacts of Mars-sized or larger bodies determine the planetary spin and form satellites. Since the giant impacts would be isotropic, tilted spins (sin $\gamma$0∼ 1) are more likely to be produced than straight ones (sin $\gamma$0∼ 0). The ratio m / Mpis dependent on the impact parameters and impactors' mass. However, most of previous studies on tidal evolution of the planet-satellite systems have focused on a particular case of the Earth-Moon systems in which m / Mp≃ 0.0125 and $\gamma$0∼ 10 ° or the two-body planar problem in which $\gamma$0= 0 ° and stellar torque is neglected. We numerically integrated the evolution of planetary spin and a satellite orbit with various m / Mp(from 0.0025 to 0.05) and $\gamma$0(from 0° to 180°), taking into account the stellar torques and precessional motions of the spin and the orbit. We start with the spin axis that almost coincides with the satellite orbit normal, assuming that the spin and the satellite are formed by one dominant impact. With initially straight spins, the evolution is similar to that of the Earth-Moon system. The satellite monotonically recedes from the planet until synchronous state between the spin period and the satellite orbital period is realized. The obliquity gradually increases initially but it starts decreasing down to zero as approaching the synchronous state. However, we have found that the evolution with initially tiled spins is completely different. The satellite's orbit migrates outward with almost constant obliquity until the orbit reaches the critical radius ∼ 10 - 20 planetary radii, but then the migration is reversed to inward one. At the reversal, the obliquity starts oscillation with large amplitude. The oscillation gradually ceases and the obliquity is reduced to ∼0° during the inward migration. The satellite eventually falls onto the planetary surface or it is captured at the synchronous state at several planetary radii. We found that the character change of precession about total angular momentum vector into that about the planetary orbit normal is responsible for the oscillation with large amplitude and the reversal of migration. With the results of numerical integration and analytical arguments, we divided the m / Mp- $\gamma$0space into the regions of the qualitatively different evolution. The peculiar tidal evolution with initially tiled spins give deep insights into dynamics of extrasolar planet-satellite systems and discussions of surface environments of the planets. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The viscosity of partially crystallized Mg3Al2Si3O12 melts has been measured under uniaxial compression in the interval 10(10) - 10(13) poise as a function of the volume fraction of crystals. These inclusions are well-rounded spherulites of aluminous enstatite, having the same composition as the melt, and whose growth rate is negligible at the temperature of the measurements. The viscosity increases by less than 1 order of magnitude for crystal fractions Phi of 40 vol {\%} and remains Newtonian up to the maximum stress exerted, namely 1 kbar. The Einstein-Roscoe equation, eta = eta(0) (1 - Phi/Phi(m))(-n), provides very good fits;to the measurements only if either the Phi(m) or n parameter is allowed to depend on temperature. For modeling of magmatic processes, however, the widely recommended constant values Phi(m) = 0.6 and n = 2.5 should be adequate. The theology changes abruptly when the clustered spherulites begin to oppose shear deformation, at a crystal fraction of about 40 vol {\%}. The viscosity becomes non-Newtonian, with yield strengths of a few tens of bars at temperatures at which the viscosity of the melt is higher than 10(10) poise. As long as the crystal fraction remains lower than 70 vol {\%}, the deformation proceeds in an irregular manner with a nonuniform distribution of crystals and melt. The deformation becomes again regular at low stresses with lower melt fractions, but samples undergo extensive fracturation along the direction of uniaxial stress. Similar theology changes have been observed during the isothermal crystallization of Li2Si2O5 melts, which produces small ellipsoidal inclusions. These results suggest that the influence of solid suspensions on the theology of magmas is primarily determined by the crystal fraction, even though additional measurements would be useful to determine the possible influence of other factors such as the size distribution or the shape of the inclusions.},

abstract = {An account is given of the experimental deformation of partially-melted granite with melt fractions up to 25{\%} at 800 °C and 300 MPa confining pressure in constant strainrate tests between 10-3 and 10-6 S-1, creep tests and cycling tests. Microscopic study reveals that under these conditions most of the uniform deformation prior to macroscopic shear failure is accomplished by melt redistribution into films perpendicular to the least compressive stress, and by axial fracturing of grains, the latter occurring even at low macroscopic differential stress. The strenght of the partially-melted rock at 10-5 S-1 is found to decrease gradually from about 250 MPa at 5 vol.{\%} melt to about 60 MPa at 15 {\%} melt, and then to drop rapidly to less than 1 MPa at 24{\%} melt. The critical melt fraction separating granular-framework-controlled flow behaviour from suspension-like behaviour is deduced to be approximately 30 to 35 vol.{\%}. At low melt fractions the deforming rock tends to take up externally available melt by a mechanism of dilatancy pumping. The relevance of these results to natural conditions involving partially-melted rocks is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1979 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Theoretical considerations and exploratory experiments indicate that most of the extreme change of large-strain "viscosities" between the solidus and the liquidus of rocks is concentrated about a non-zero rheological critical melt percentage (RCMP). Usually the RCMP is within the range of 20 ± 10 vol{\%}. Below it, both bulk shear and segregative-compactive filter pressing are drastically slowed down, requiring strains in the solid fraction and squeezing of thin melt films. Many geological consequences of these critical phenomena may be far reaching. In particular, most of the upper-mantle low-velocity zone (LVZ), if partially melted, is likely to be stabilized somewhat below the RCMP, with runaway excesses of heat, melt and shear strain creating local excursions over the RCMP. Flow may be thus concentrated in narrow high-melt channels, within a relatively unsheared LVZ. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Variation in the isotopic composition of material within the early inner Solar System is usually thought to reflect spatial heterogeneity in the protoplanetary disk. Martin Schiller and co-authors find that the calcium isotope composition of samples from the parent bodies of ureilite and angrite meteorites, as well as from Vesta, Mars and Earth, are correlated to the masses of their inferred parent asteroids and planets. This provides a proxy for their accretion timescales and implies a rapid 'secular' evolution of the bulk calcium isotope composition of the disk in the rocky-planet-forming region. The authors infer that this secular evolution reflects the introduction of pristine outer-Solar-System material to the thermally processed inner protoplanetary disk associated with the accretion of mass to the proto-Sun. They also conclude that the indistinguishable calcium isotope composition of the Earth and the Moon implies that the Moon-forming impact involved protoplanets that completed their accretion near the end of the disk's lifetime.},

abstract = {The Earth was born in violence. Many giant collisions of protoplanets are thought to have occurred during the terrestrial planet formation. Here we investigated the giant impact stage by using a hybrid code that consistently deals with the orbital evolution of protoplanets around the Sun and the details of processes during giant impacts between two protoplanets. A significant amount of materials (up to several tens of percent of the total mass of the protoplanets) is ejected by giant impacts. We call these ejected fragments the giant-impact fragments (GIFs). In some of the erosive hit-and-run and high-velocity collisions, metallic iron is also ejected, which comes from the colliding protoplanets' cores. From ten numerical simulations for the giant impact stage, we found that the mass fraction of metallic iron in GIFs ranges from ∼1 wt{\%} to ∼25 wt{\%}. We also discussed the effects of the GIFs on the dynamical and geochemical characteristics of formed terrestrial planets. We found that the GIFs have the potential to solve the following dynamical and geochemical conflicts: (1) The Earth, currently in a near circular orbit, is likely to have had a highly eccentric orbit during the giant impact stage. The GIFs are large enough in total mass to lower the eccentricity of the Earth to its current value via their dynamical friction. (2) The concentrations of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the Earth's mantle are greater than what was predicted experimentally. Re-accretion of the iron-bearing GIFs onto the Earth can contribute to the excess of HSEs. In addition, Iron-bearing GIFs provide significant reducing agent that could transform primitive CO2–H2O atmosphere and ocean into more reducing H2-bearing atmosphere. Thus, GIFs are important for the origin of Earth's life and its early evolution.},

Partial melting can still occur today in the mantle, but at limited degrees of partial melting (F) and in specific regions. It occurs close to the Earth's surface when hot mantle mate-rials undergo decompression, as at mid-ocean ridges.

abstract = {Basaltic magmas constitute the primary mass flux from Earth's mantle to its crust, carrying information about the conditions of mantle melting through which they were generated. As such, changes in the average basaltic geochemistry through time reflect changes in underlying parameters such as mantle potential temperature and the geodynamic setting of mantle melting. However, sampling bias, preservation bias, and geological heterogeneity complicate the calculation of representative average compositions. Here we use weighted bootstrap resampling to minimize sampling bias over the heterogeneous rock record and obtain maximally representative average basaltic compositions through time. Over the approximately 4 Ga of the continental rock record, the average composition of preserved continental basalts has evolved along a generally continuous trajectory, with decreasing compatible element concentrations and increasing incompatible element concentrations, punctuated by a comparatively rapid transition in some variables such as La/Yb ratios and Zr, Nb, and Ti abundances approximately 2.5 Ga ago. Geochemical modeling of mantle melting systematics and trace element partitioning suggests that these observations can be explained by discontinuous changes in the mineralogy of mantle partial melting driven by a gradual decrease in mantle potential temperature, without appealing to any change in tectonic process. This interpretation is supported by the geochemical record of slab fluid input to continental basalts, which indicates no long-term change in the global proportion of arc versus non-arc basaltic magmatism at any time in the preserved rock record.},

We first analyze experimental data to provide a critical review of flow law parameters for olivine aggregates and single crystals deformed in the diffusion creep and dislocation creep regimes under both wet and dry conditions. Using rea- sonable values for the physical state of the upper mantle, the viscosities predicted by extrapolation of the experimental flow laws compare well with independent esti- mates for the viscosity of the oceanic mantle, which is approximately 1019 Pa s at a depth of {\~{}}100 km. The viscosity of the mantle wedge of subduction zones could be even lower if the flux of water through it can result in olivine water contents greater than those estimated for the oceanic asthenosphere and promote the onset of melting. Calculations of the partitioning of water between hydrous melt and mantle peridotite suggest that the water content of the residue of arc melting is similar to that estimat- ed for the asthenosphere. Thus, transport of water from the slab into the mantle wedge can continually replenish the water content of the upper mantle and facilitate the existence of a low viscosity asthenosphere.},

The vapor is strongly depleted in Mg at low temperature and approaches the composition of the liquid near the critical point. We find that the liquid-vapor critical temperature ([Formula: see text] K) is much lower than assumed in hydrodynamic simulations, pointing to much more extensive supercritical fluid after the Moon-forming impact than previously thought. The structure of the near-critical liquid is very different from what has been studied previously and includes a significant fraction (10{\%}) of molecular species SiO and O2.},

abstract = {The Earth is in a plate tectonics regime with high surface heat flow concentrated at constructive plate boundaries. Other terrestrial bodies that lack plate tectonics are thought to lose their internal heat by conduction through their lids and volcanism: hotter planets (Io and Venus) show widespread volcanism whereas colder ones (modern Mars and Mercury) are less volcanically active. However, studies of terrestrial magmatic processes show that less than 20{\%} of melt volcanically erupts, with most melt intruding into the crust. Signatures of large magmatic intrusions are also found on other planets. Yet, the influence of intrusive magmatism on planetary cooling remains unclear. Here we use numerical magmatic-thermo-mechanical models to simulate global mantle convection in a planetary interior. In our simulations, warm intrusive magmatism acts to thin the lithosphere, leading to sustained recycling of overlying crustal material and cooling of the mantle. In contrast, volcanic eruptions lead to a thick lithosphere that insulates the upper mantle and prevents efficient cooling. We find that heat loss due to intrusive magmatism can be particularly efficient compared to volcanic eruptions if the partitioning of heat-producing radioactive elements into the melt phase is weak. We conclude that the mode of magmatism experienced by rocky bodies determines the thermal and compositional evolution of their interior.},

abstract = {Tidal friction in exoplanet systems, driven by orbits that allow for durable nonzero eccentricities at short heliocentric periods, can generate internal heating far in excess of the conditions observed in our own solar system. Secular perturbations or a notional 2:1 resonance between a hot Earth and hot Jupiter can be used as a baseline to consider the thermal evolution of convecting bodies subject to strong viscoelastic tidal heating. We compare results first from simple models using a fixed Quality factor and Love number, and then for three different viscoelastic rheologies: the Maxwell body, the Standard Anelastic Solid (SAS), and the Burgers body. The SAS and Burgers models are shown to alter the potential for extreme tidal heating by introducing the possibility of new equilibria and multiple response peaks. We find that tidal heating tends to exceed radionuclide heating at periods below 10-30 days, and exceed insolation only below 1-2 days. Extreme cases produce enough tidal heat to initiate global-scale partial melting, and an analysis of tidal limiting mechanisms such as advective cooling for earthlike planets is discussed. To explore long-term behaviors, we map equilibria points between convective heat loss and tidal heat input as functions of eccentricity. For the periods and magnitudes discussed, we show that tidal heating, if significant, is generally detrimental to the width of habitable zones.},

@article{Malamud2018,
abstract = {During the last stages of the terrestrial planet formation, planets grow mainly through giant-impacts with large planetary embryos. The Earth's Moon was suggested to form through one of these impacts. However, since the proto-Earth has experienced many giant-impacts, several moons are naturally expected to form through a sequence of multiple (including smaller scale) impacts. Each impact potentially forms a sub-Lunar mass moonlet that interacts gravitationally with the proto-Earth and possibly with previously-formed moonlets. Such interactions result in either moonlet-moonlet mergers, moonlet ejections or infall of moonlets on the Earth. The latter possibility, leading to low-velocity moonlet-Earth collisions is explored here for the first time. We make use of SPH simulations and consider a range of moonlet masses, collision impact-angles and initial proto-Earth rotation rates. We find that grazing/tidal-collisions are the most frequent and produce comparable fractions of accreted-material and debris. The latter typically clump in smaller moonlets that can potentially later interact with other moonlets. Other collision geometries are more rare. Head-on collisions do not produce much debris and are effectively perfect mergers. Intermediate impact angles result in debris mass-fractions in the range of 2-25{\%} where most of the material is unbound. Retrograde collisions produce more debris than prograde collisions, whose fractions depend on the proto-Earth initial rotation rate. Moonfalls can slightly change the rotation-rate of the proto-Earth. Accreted moonfall material is highly localized, potentially explaining the isotopic heterogeneities in highly siderophile elements in terrestrial rocks, and possibly forming primordial super-continent topographic features. Our results can be used for simple scaling laws and applied to n-body studies of the formation of the Earth and Moon.},

abstract = {The depletions of potassium (K) and sodium (Na) in samples from planetary interiors have long been considered as primary evidence for their volatile behavior during planetary formation processes. Here, we use high-pressure experiments combined with laser ablation analyses to measure the sulfide-silicate and metal-silicate partitioning of K and Na at high pressure (P) – temperature (T) and find that their partitioning into metal strongly increases with temperature. Results indicate that the observed Vestan and Martian mantle K and Na depletions can reflect sequestration into their sulfur-rich cores in addition to their volatility during formation of Mars and Vesta. This suggests that alkali depletions are not affected solely by incomplete condensation or partial volatilization during planetary formation and differentiation, but additionally or even primarily reflect the thermal and chemical conditions during core formation. Core sequestration is also significant for the Moon, but lunar mantle depletions of K and Na cannot be reconciled by core formation only. This supports the hypothesis that measured isotopic fractionations of K in lunar samples represent incomplete condensation or extensive volatile loss during the Moon-forming giant impact.},

The numerical methods that underlie these simulations have greatly evolved within this time span, and today include dynamically changing and adaptively refined meshes, sophisticated and efficient solvers, and parallelization to large clusters of computers. At the same time, many of these methods -- discussed in detail in a previous paper in this series -- were developed and tested primarily using model problems that lack many of the complexities that are common to the realistic models our community wants to solve today. With several years of experience solving complex and realistic models, we here revisit some of the algorithm designs of the earlier paper and discuss the incorporation of more complex physics. In particular, we re-consider time stepping and mesh refinement algorithms, evaluate approaches to incorporate compressibility, and discuss dealing with strongly varying material coefficients, latent heat, and how to track chemical compositions and heterogeneities. Taken together and implemented in a high-performance, massively parallel code, the techniques discussed in this paper then allow for high resolution, 3d, compressible, global mantle convection simulations with phase transitions, strongly temperature dependent viscosity and realistic material properties based on mineral physics data.},

Specifically, we show how an interconnected set of methods for adaptive mesh refine- ment (AMR), higher order spatial and temporal discretizations, advection stabilization and efficient linear solvers can provide high accuracy at a numerical cost unachievable with traditional methods, and how these methods can be designed in a way so that they scale to large number of processors on compute clusters.

Water ocean mass is determined as a result not only of water delivery and loss, but also of water partitioning among several reservoirs. Here we review our current understanding of water partitioning among the atmosphere, magma ocean, and solid mantle of accreting planetary embryos and protoplanets just after giant collisions. Magma oceans are readily formed in planetary embryos and protoplanets in their accretion phase. Significant amounts of water are partitioned into magma oceans, provided the planetary building blocks are water-rich enough. Particularly important but still quite uncertain issues are how much water the planetary building blocks contain initially and how water goes out of the solidifying mantle and is finally degassed to the atmosphere. Constraints from both solar-system explorations and exoplanet observations and also from laboratory experiments are needed to resolve these issues.},

New experiments reveal that impact melts and breccias capture up to 30{\%} of the water carried by carbonaceous chondrite–like projectiles under impact conditions typical of the main asteroid belt impact and the early phases of planet formation. This impactor-derived water resides in two distinct reservoirs: in impact melts and projectile survivors. Impact melt hosts the bulk of the delivered water. Entrapment of water within impact glasses and melt-bearing breccias is therefore a plausible source of hydration features associated with craters on the Moon and elsewhere in the solar system and likely contributed to the early accretion of water during planet formation.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that Mars' moons formed from a disk produced by a large impact with the planet. However, whether such an event could produce tiny Phobos and Deimos remains unclear. Using a hybrid N -body model of moon accumulation that includes a full treatment of moon-moon dynamical interactions, we first identify new constraints on the disk properties needed to produce Phobos and Deimos. We then simulate the impact formation of disks using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, including a novel approach that resolves the impact ejecta with order-of-magnitude finer mass resolution than existing methods. We find that forming Phobos-Deimos requires an oblique impact by a Vesta-to-Ceres sized object with {\~{}}10−3 times Mars' mass, a much less massive impactor than previously considered.},

abstract = {The early Earth's environment is controversial. Climatic estimates range from hot to glacial, and inferred marine pH spans strongly alkaline to acidic. Better understanding of early climate and ocean chemistry would improve our knowledge of the origin of life and its coevolution with the environment. Here, we use a geological carbon cycle model with ocean chemistry to calculate self-consistent histories of climate and ocean pH. Our carbon cycle model includes an empirically justified temperature and pH dependence of seafloor weathering, allowing the relative importance of continental and seafloor weathering to be evaluated. We find that the Archean climate was likely temperate (0-50 °C) due to the combined negative feedbacks of continental and seafloor weathering. Ocean pH evolves monotonically from [Formula: see text] (2$\sigma$) at 4.0 Ga to [Formula: see text] (2$\sigma$) at the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, and to [Formula: see text] (2$\sigma$) at the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary. This evolution is driven by the secular decline of pCO2, which in turn is a consequence of increasing solar luminosity, but is moderated by carbonate alkalinity delivered from continental and seafloor weathering. Archean seafloor weathering may have been a comparable carbon sink to continental weathering, but is less dominant than previously assumed, and would not have induced global glaciation. We show how these conclusions are robust to a wide range of scenarios for continental growth, internal heat flow evolution and outgassing history, greenhouse gas abundances, and changes in the biotic enhancement of weathering.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity in Earth's mantle is a record of chemical and dynamic processes over Earth's history. The geophysical signatures of heterogeneity can only be interpreted with quantitative constraints on effects of major elements such as iron on physical properties including density, compressibility, and electrical conductivity. However, deconvolution of the effects of multiple valence and spin states of iron in bridgmanite (Bdg), the most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, has been challenging. Here we show through a study of a ferric-iron-only (Mg0.46Fe3+0.53)(Si0.49Fe3+0.51)O3 Bdg that Fe3+ in the octahedral site undergoes a spin transition between 43 and 53 GPa at 300 K. The resolved effects of the spin transition on density, bulk sound velocity, and electrical conductivity are smaller than previous estimations, consistent with the smooth depth profiles from geophysical observations. For likely mantle compositions, the valence state of iron has minor effects on density and sound velocities relative to major cation composition.},

abstract = {The Moon bears a striking compositional and isotopic resemblance to the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) for many elements, but is considered highly depleted in many volatile elements compared to BSE due to high-temperature volatile loss from Moon-forming materials in the Moon-forming giant impact and/or due to evaporative loss during subsequent magmatism on the Moon. Here, we use high-pressure metal-silicate partitioning experiments to show that the observed low concentrations of volatile elements sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and antimony (Sb) in the silicate Moon can instead reflect core-mantle equilibration in a largely to fully molten Moon. When incorporating the core as a reservoir for these elements, their bulk Moon concentrations are similar to those in the present-day bulk silicate Earth. This suggests that Moon formation was not accompanied by major loss of S, Se, Te, Sb from Moon-forming materials, consistent with recent indications from lunar carbon and S isotopic compositions of primitive lunar materials. This is in marked contrast with the losses of other volatile elements (e.g., K, Zn) during the Moon-forming event. This discrepancy may be related to distinctly different cosmochemical behavior of S, Se, Te and Sb within the proto-lunar disk, which is as of yet virtually unconstrained.},

Here we modeled the geochemical influence of the giant impact on Earth's mantle and found that impactors larger than 15{\%} of Earth mass result in mantles always violating the present-day concentrations of four refractory moderately siderophile trace elements (Ni, Co, Cr, and V). In the aftermath of the impact, our models cannot further discriminate between a fully and a partially molten bulk silicate Earth. Then, the preservation of primordial geochemical reservoirs predating the Moon remains the sole argument against a fully molten mantle after the Moon-forming impact.},

abstract = {Anorthosites that comprise the bulk of the lunar crust are believed to have formed during solidification of a Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) in which these rocks would have floated to the surface. This early flotation crust would have formed a thermal blanket over the remaining LMO, prolonging solidification. Geochronology of lunar anorthosites indicates a long timescale of LMO cooling, or re-melting and re-crystallization in one or more late events. To better interpret this geochronology, we model LMO solidification in a scenario where the Moon is being continuously bombarded by returning projectiles released from the Moon-forming giant impact. More than one lunar mass of material escaped the Earth-Moon system onto heliocentric orbits following the giant impact, much of it to come back on returning orbits for a period of 100 Myr. If large enough, these projectiles would have punctured holes in the nascent floatation crust of the Moon, exposing the LMO to space and causing more rapid cooling. We model these scenarios using a thermal evolution model of the Moon that allows for production (by cratering) and evolution (solidification and infill) of holes in the flotation crust that insulates the LMO. For effective hole production, solidification of the magma ocean can be significantly expedited, decreasing the cooling time by more than a factor of 5. If hole production is inefficient, but shock conversion of projectile kinetic energy to thermal energy is efficient, then LMO solidification can be somewhat prolonged, lengthening the cooling time by 50{\%} or more.},

The thermochemical pile models predict a relatively flat but elevated CMB beneath piles (presumed LLSVPs), with strong upwarping along LLSVP margins. The plume cluster models predict CMB upwarping beneath upwellings that are less geographically organized. Both models display CMB depressions beneath subduction related downwelling.

@article{Nakajima2018,
abstract = {The Earth's Moon is thought to have formed from a circumterrestrial disk generated by a giant impact between the proto-Earth and an impactor approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Since this impact was energetic, the disk would have been hot (4000–6000 K) and partially vaporized (20–100{\%} by mass). This formation process is thought to be responsible for the geochemical observation that the Moon is depleted in volatiles (e.g., K and Na). To explain this volatile depletion, some studies suggest the Moon-forming disk was rich in hydrogen, which was dissociated from water, and it escaped from the disk as a hydrodynamic wind accompanying heavier volatiles (hydrodynamic escape). This model predicts that the Moon should be significantly depleted in water, but this appears to contradict some of the recently measured lunar water abundances and D/H ratios that suggest that the Moon is more water-rich than previously thought. Alternatively, the Moon could have retained its water if the upper parts (low pressure regions) of the disk were dominated by heavier species because hydrogen would have had to diffuse out from the heavy-element rich disk, and therefore the escape rate would have been limited by this slow diffusion process (diffusion-limited escape). To identify which escape the disk would have experienced and to quantify volatiles loss from the disk, we compute the thermal structure of the Moon-forming disk considering various bulk water abundances (100–1000 ppm) and mid-plane disk temperatures (2500–4000 K). Assuming that the disk consists of silicate (SiO2or Mg2SiO4) and water and that the disk is in the chemical equilibrium, our calculations show that the upper parts of the Moon-forming disk are dominated by heavy atoms or molecules (SiO and O at Tmid{\textgreater}2500–2800 K and H2O at Tmid{\textless}2500–2800 K) and hydrogen is a minor species. This indicates that hydrogen escape would have been diffusion-limited, and therefore the amount of lost water and hydrogen would have been small compared to the initial abundance assumed. This result indicates that the giant impact hypothesis can be consistent with the water-rich Moon. Furthermore, since the hydrogen wind would have been weak, the other volatiles would not have escaped either. Thus, the observed volatile depletion of the Moon requires another mechanism.},

Measurements were made in an oscillating‐disk viscometer at 20° and 30°C and at pressures from 1–25 atm, approximately; they were evaluated by the relative method. An analysis of the data shows that the interaction quantity $\mu$12 which appears in the Chapman–Enskog theory for low densities is sensibly independent of composition. Although no direct check on the accepted mixing rules can be made owing to the narrowness of the temperature range covered, it is concluded that a knowledge of the viscosities $\mu$1 and $\mu$2 of the pure components together with that of $\mu$12 at each temperature is sufficient to determine the dependence of the viscosity of the mixture on composition with the aid of the Chapman–Enskog theory. This dependence is reproduced well by the theory at virtually zero density and at a constant temperature. The experimental values of $\mu$12 are used to calculate the bina...},

The method used is a variation of the usual capillary viscometry scheme in that no attempt is made to obtain absolute viscosity values. The measurements provide the ratio of the viscosity of a gas at temperature T to its viscosity at the reference temperature, 283°K. The value of T ranges from 1100°K to 2150°K and is measured by a disappearing filament pyrometer. In this relative method there is cancellation of most noncontrolled experimental variables so that the measurements are of high reproducibility, ±0.1{\%}, and apparently accuracy, ±0.4{\%}, is limited only by the uncertainties in the international temperature scale in the optical pyrometer range. These results are higher by 3{\%}‐8{\%} compared with the results of previous workers. However, extrapolation of lower‐temperature viscosity measurements by Kestin and Leidenfrost, and more recently by DiPippo, gives excellent agreement with the values reported here.},

Colin Jackson and co-authors present measurements of iodine partitioning between liquid iron alloys and liquid silicates at high pressure and temperature to mimic the conditions within the early Earth. They propose that xenon isotopic anomalies found in modern plume rocks—the result of rock rising up from within the mantle—result from iodine/plutonium fractionations during early, high-pressure episodes of core formation. The authors conclude that portions of the mantle involved at this stage of core formation would also be rich in iron oxides, and hence denser than ambient mantle, aiding their long-term preservation.},

abstract = {Advances in our understanding of Earth's thermal evolution and the style of mantle convection rely on robust seismological constraints on lateral variations of density. The large-low-shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) atop the core-mantle boundary beneath Africa and the Pacific are the largest structures in the lower mantle, and hence severely affect the convective flow. Here, we show that anomalous splitting of Stoneley modes, a unique class of free oscillations that are perturbed primarily by velocity and density variations at the core-mantle boundary, is explained best when the overall density of the LLSVPs is lower than the surrounding mantle. The resolved density variations can be explained by the presence of post-perovskite, chemical heterogeneity or a combination of the two. Although we cannot rule out the presence of a ∼100-km-thick denser-than-average basal structure, our results support the hypothesis that LLSVPs signify large-scale mantle upwelling in two antipodal regions of the mantle.},

abstract = {We have developed an idealized mathematical model to understand the isotopic variability of the mantle and its relation to the observed variations in isotopic ratios143Nd/144Nd,87Sr/86Sr,176Hf/177Hf,208Pb/204Pb,206Pb/204Pb, and207Pb/204Pb measured on mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). We consider a simple box model of mantle processes. A single melt region produces a melt fraction F of melt, and the average time since a given parcel of mantle material last visited this region is given by the time scale $\tau$melt. The melt region fractionates the parent/daughter ratios. Over time this leads to variations in the mantle isotopic ratios as the parent decays to the daughter. Key assumptions are that the half-life of the parent isotope is large compared with $\tau$melt, that the flow is strongly stirring, and that the mantle has reached a statistical steady state. This enables us to neglect the specifics of the underlying flow. Sampling from our model mantle is dealt with by averaging over a large number N of samples to represent the mixing after melting. The model predicts a probability density for isotopic ratios in MORB which, with exception of the Pb isotopes, are consistent with measurements. Fitting the MORB data to this model gives estimates of the model parameters F, $\tau$melt, and N. Small melt fractions with F around 0.5{\%} are essential for a good fit, whereas $\tau$meltand N are less well constrained. $\tau$meltis estimated at around 1.4 to 2.4 Ga, and N is of the order of hundreds. The model predicts a larger vari ability for the Pb isotopes than that observed. As has been stated by many previous authors, it appears that fundamental differences exist between the dynamics of Pb isotopes and those of Nd, Sr and Hf isotopes.

@article{Kellogg2002,
abstract = {We present an extension of the conventional geochemical reservoir model for the evolution of the Earth's crust-mantle system in which we calculate not only the mean isotopic ratios, but also the distribution of those ratios within the reservoirs. Owing to low chemical diffusion rates, subreservoirs that are created by mass transport into and out of the mantle effectively exist as distinct geochemical entities for all time. By tracking these subreservoirs, we obtain a model of the full range of isotopic values represented in the mantle. Using results from numerical calculations of mixing, we also track the length scales associated with each subreservoir. Applying simple statistics, we obtain the distribution of expected measurements as a function of the stirring time, effective melt fraction, sampling volume, and mass transport history. We present calculations of isotopic heterogeneity for two simple mantle evolution models and explore the sensitivity of geochemical observables to the variables mentioned. We focus on the Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd systems and are able to reproduce much of the observed complexity of oceanic basalts. We infer that the stirring time of the mantle falls between 250 and 750 Myr, and that the initial length scale of mantle heterogeneity before stirring is of the same order as the length scale of sampling. We also conclude that the differences between isotopic data from mid-ocean ridge basalts and ocean island basalts cannot simply be due to differences in sampling volume, but must also reflect differences in the source reservoirs and/or melting processes. Increasing the size of the ocean island basalt source region by 45{\%} with respect to the mid-ocean ridge basalt source region reproduces the offset between the two distributions, but still fails to explain the more isotopically extreme measurements. Our results show that the argument suggesting that the absence of samples with a primitive isotopic signature indicates that no primitive material remains in the mantle is not valid. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Kasting1993,
abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

abstract = {We derive an estimate for the chemical composition of the depleted MORB mantle (DMM), the source reservoir to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which represents at least 30{\%} the mass of the whole silicate Earth. A database for the chemical and physical properties of abyssal peridotites has become robust and complete enough to truly access a reference DMM. Using trace element depletion trends from the abyssal peridotites, it is possible to construct a large part of DMM's trace element pattern. Splicing this information with isotopic constraints (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf) and canonical ratios (Ce/Pb, Nb/Ta, Nb/U, Ba/Rb, H2O/Ce, CO2/Nb and Cl/K), we can extend abundance estimates to all the incompatible elements including volatile content. The resulting trace element pattern for average DMM constrains parental MORB to be generated by 6{\%} aggregated fractional melting, consistent with recent models for hydrous melting of the mantle [P.D. Asimow, J.E. Dixon, C.H. Langmuir, A hydrous melting and fractionation model for mid-ocean ridge basalts: application to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the Azores, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 5 (2004) 10.1029/2003GC000568]. We show that DMM is roughly balanced by the continental crust and better balanced upon inclusion of ocean island basalt source and oceanic crust components.

abstract = {Many dynamical aspects of the solar system can be explained by the outer planets experiencing a period of orbital instability sometimes called the Nice Model. Though often correlated with a perceived delayed spike in the lunar cratering record known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), recent work suggests that this event may have occurred much earlier; perhaps during the epoch of terrestrial planet formation. While current simulations of terrestrial accretion can reproduce many observed qualities of the solar system, replicating the small mass of Mars requires modification to standard planet formation models. Here we use 800 dynamical simulations to show that an early instability in the outer solar system strongly influences terrestrial planet formation and regularly yields properly sized Mars analogs. Our most successful outcomes occur when the terrestrial planets evolve an additional 1-10 million years (Myr) following the dispersal of the gas disk, before the onset of the giant planet instability. In these simulations, accretion has begun in the Mars region before the instability, but the dynamical perturbation induced by the giant planets' scattering removes large embryos from Mars' vicinity. Large embryos are either ejected or scattered inward toward Earth and Venus (in some cases to deliver water), and Mars is left behind as a stranded embryo. An early giant planet instability can thus replicate both the inner and outer solar system in a single model.},

@article{Benz1989a,
abstract = {In previous papers in this series the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method (SPH) has been used to explore the conditions in which a major planetary collision may have been responsible for the formation of the Moon. In Paper II (W. Benz, W.L. Slattery, and A.G.W. Cameron 1987, Icarus 71, 30-45) it was found that the optimum conditions were obtained when the mass ratio of the impactor to the protoearth was 0.136. In the present paper we investigate the importance of the equation of state by running this optimum case several times and varying the equation of state and other related parameters. The two equations of state compared are the Tillotson (used in the previous papers) and the CHART D/CSQ ANEOS. Because of differences in these equations of state, including the fact that different types of rocks were used in association with each, it was not possible to prepare initial planetary models that were comparable in every respect, so several different simulations were necessary in which different planetary parameters were matched between the equations of state. We also used a new version of the SPH code. The results reaffirmed the previous principal conclusions: the collisions produced a disk of rocky material in orbit, with most of the material derived from the impacting object. These results indicate that the equation of state is not a critical factor in determining the amount of material thrown into orbit. This confirms the conclusions of Paper II that gravitational torques, and not pressure gradients, inject the orbiting mass. However, the way this mass is distributed in orbit is affected by the equation of state and the choice of rock material, the Tillotson equation for granite giving a slightly larger mean orbital radius for the particles left in orbit than the ANEOS dunite for the same impact parameter. We also find, compared to Paper II, that in all subsequent cases the new SPH code leads to a slightly less extended prelunar accretion disk. We think this is due to the new shape adopted for the kernel. A few additional calculations were made to test the effects of increasing the impact parameter on the calculations, other parameters remaining unchanged. The motivation for this was that solar tides will have reduced the Earth-Moon angular momentum somewhat over the course of time. An increment of 6{\%} in the angular momentum of the collision increases the amount of iron-free material in orbit and its mean orbital radius, but more than that leaves increasing amounts of iron in orbit (the iron has a small mean orbital radius). The debris from the destroyed impacting object tends to form a straight rotating bar which is very effective in transferring angular momentum. If the material near the end of the bar extends well beyond the Roche lobe, it may become unstable against gravitational clumping. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Geochemical studies of planetary accretion and evolution have invoked various degrees of collisional erosion to explain differences in bulk composition between planets and chondrites. Here we undertake a full, dynamical evaluation of ‘crustal stripping' during accretion and its key geochemical consequences. Crusts are expected to contain a significant fraction of planetary budgets of incompatible elements, which include the major heat producing nuclides. We present smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions between differentiated rocky planetesimals and planetary embryos. We find that the crust is preferentially lost relative to the mantle during impacts, and we have developed a scaling law based on these simulations that approximates the mass of crust that remains in the largest remnant. Using this scaling law and a recent set of N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation, we have estimated the maximum effect of crustal stripping on incompatible element abundances during the accretion of planetary embryos. We find that on average approximately one third of the initial crust is stripped from embryos as they accrete, which leads to a reduction of ∼20{\%} in the budgets of the heat producing elements if the stripped crust does not reaccrete. Erosion of crusts can lead to non-chondritic ratios of incompatible elements, but the magnitude of this effect depends sensitively on the details of the crust-forming melting process on the planetesimals. The Lu/Hf system is fractionated for a wide range of crustal formation scenarios. Using eucrites (the products of planetesimal silicate melting, thought to represent the crust of Vesta) as a guide to the Lu/Hf of planetesimal crust partially lost during accretion, we predict the Earth could evolve to a superchondritic176Hf/177Hf (3–5 parts per ten thousand) at present day. Such values are in keeping with compositional estimates of the bulk Earth. Stripping of planetary crusts during accretion can lead to detectable changes in bulk composition of lithophile elements, but the fractionation is relatively subtle, and sensitive to the efficiency of reaccretion.},

abstract = {Chondrites are extraordinary mixtures of materials with diverse origins that formed around other stars, in the solar nebula, and in their parent asteroids. Most chondrites were so severely altered by aqueous fluids, thermal metamorphism, and impacts that the original characteristics of their components have been largely erased. But a few pristine chondrites have preserved an exquisite mineralogical, chemical, isotopic, and chronological record of the first few million years of solar system history. The properties of diverse types of carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondrites focusing on the most pristine samples are reviewed to establish the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical properties and origins of their components and to elucidate the asteroidal processes that modified them. Refractory inclusions - amoeboid olivine aggregates and Ca-Al-rich inclusions - were the first solids to form in the solar nebula near to the protosun. Chondrules and associated metallic Fe-Ni grains were still forming several million years later when the earliest planetesimals, which melted due to heat from26Al decay, were colliding. In the least-altered chondrites, matrix material, which coats chondrules and other components, is largely composed of micrometer-sized silicates and amorphous materials, which formed at high temperatures, plus small amounts (up to 200ppm) of presolar oxides and silicates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Passage through these resonances can excite large lunar orbital eccentricity and modify the inclination of the Moon to the equator.

abstract = {Solidification of magma oceans (MOs) formed early in the evolution of planetary bodies sets the initial condition for their evolution on much longer time scales. Ideal fractional crystallization would generate an unstable chemical stratification that subsequently overturns to form a stably stratified mantle. The simplest model of overturn assumes that cumulates remain immobile until the end of MO solidification. However, overturning of cumulates and thermal convection during solidification may act to reduce this stratification and introduce chemical heterogeneity on scales smaller than the MO thickness. We explore overturning of cumulates before the end of MO crystallization and the possible consequences for mantle structure and composition. In this model, increasingly dense iron-rich layers, crystallized from the overlying residual liquid MO, are deposited on a thickening cumulate layer. Overturn during solidification occurs if the dimensionless parameter, Rc, measuring the ratio of the MO time of crystallization $\tau$MO to the timescale associated with compositional overturn $\tau$ov=$\mu$/$\Delta$$\rho$gH exceeds a threshold value. If overturn did not occur until after solidification, this implies that the viscosity of the solidified mantle must have been sufficiently high (possibly requiring efficient melt extraction from the cumulate) for a given rate of solidification. For the lunar MO, possible implications for the generation of the Mg-suites and mare basalt are suggested.},

abstract = {The mantle perspective provided by radiogenic isotope geochemistry has evolved over the last 40 years. Although the idea of an upper mantle depleted in incompatible elements by extraction of partial melt remains, ideas about the lower mantle have evolved from simple primitive material occupying the lower two-thirds of the mantle to a heterogeneous, multicomponent lower mantle. The lower mantle is sampled by plumes rising from it, and although each is compositionally unique, these plumes can be divided into 5 or 6 genera with the compositional similarity within each suggesting they have evolved in similar ways. The dominant signature in these plumes is that of lithospheric material carried into the deep mantle through subduction, subduction erosion, and continental foundering, and these processes have also polluted and refertilized the depleted upper mantle. The stable isotope geochemistry of these plumes confirms the presence of recycled material, including material derived from the continents, oceans and atmosphere. Noble gas isotope ratios provide a dramatically different perspective: that of reservoirs of noble gases isolated from the convecting mantle for the entire history of the Earth. Neither perspective is likely to be wrong and the conclusion to be drawn is that plumes, at least some of them, draw on reservoirs of both recycled and primitive material from the deep mantle. The difference in noble gas content in the primitive and recycled material may well be such that the primitive noble gas isotopic signature dominates in any mixture of these. In the meantime, the suprachondritic142Nd/144Nd ratio of the modern mantle has reopened the question of the composition of the Earth and therefore primitive mantle. If this is not entirely a result of nebular isotopic heterogeneity, then "primitive mantle", defined as the composition that has given rise to the lithosphere and convecting mantle, appears to be depleted in light rare earths, and likely other incompatible elements such as U and Th. This material would have $\epsilon$Ndin the range of 3 to 7, which matches the most common compositions observed in oceanic island basalts, particularly those of the PREMA genera. PREMA cannot be truly primitive mantle, even defined in this way, instead, it appears to consist of balanced mix of recycled enriched and depleted components with only a limited contribution from long-isolated, nearly primitive material. As the geochemical perspective of the mantle has evolved, so has the geophysical one, and it now reveals a highly heterogeneous lowermost mantle dominated by two large low-shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the South Pacific and associated with the DUPAL anomaly. The latter appears to actually be two anomalies, DUPAL and SOPITA, each closely associated with an LLSVP. Mantle plumes have now been shown to preferentially rise from the margins of these structures, while subduction zones overly apparently cold high-seismic velocity regions surrounding the LLSVPs. The LLSVPs appear to be both hot and dense, and may consist of the PRIMA-like mixture of recycled and primitive material present in many mantle plumes. Geoneutrino studies may eventually resolve some of these questions, including both the total amount of U and Th in the Earth and whether these elements are concentrated within the LLSVPs.},

abstract = {Chondrules are millimeter-sized silicate spherules ubiquitous in primitive meteorites, but whose origin remains mysterious. One of the main proposed mechanisms for producing them is melting of solids in shock waves in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. However, evidence is mounting that chondrule-forming regions were enriched in solids well above solar abundances. Given the high velocities involved in shock models, destructive collisions would be expected between differently sized grains after passage of the shock front as a result of differential drag. We investigate the probability and outcome of collisions of particles behind a one-dimensional shock using analytic methods as well as a full integration of the coupled mass, momentum, energy, and radiation equations. Destruction of protochondrules seems unavoidable for solid/gas ratios 0.1, and possibly even for solar abundances because of " sandblasting " by finer dust. A flow with 10 requires much smaller shock velocities (∼2 versus 8 km s −1) in order to achieve chondrule-melting temperatures, and radiation trapping allows slow cooling of the shocked fragments. Initial destruction would still be extensive; although re-assembly of millimeter-sized particles would naturally occur by grain sticking afterward, the compositional heterogeneity of chondrules may be difficult to reproduce. We finally note that solids passing through small-scale bow shocks around few kilometer-sized planetesimals might experience partial melting and yet escape fragmentation.},

abstract = {Sphere drag data from throughout the twentieth century are available in tabular form. However, much of the data arose from experiments in small diameter cylindrical vessels, where the results might have been influenced by the wall effect. Wall effect corrections developed by others were applied to 178 of the 480 data points collected. This corrected data set is believed to be free of the influence of wall effects. Existing drag and settling velocity correlations were compared to this data set. In addition, new correlations of the same forms were developed using the corrected data. Two new correlations of sphere terminal velocity are proposed, one applicable for all Reynolds numbers less than 2 X 10(5), and the other designed to predict settling velocities with exceptional accuracy for terminal Reynolds numbers less than 4,000, a region that contains almost all applications of interest in environmental engineering. The trial and error solution for settling velocity using the Fair and Geyer equation for drag should be retired in favor of the direct calculation available from these new correlations.},

abstract = {The mass-dependent fractionation laws that describe the partitioning of isotopes are different for kinetic and equilibrium reactions. These laws are characterized by the exponent relating the fractionation factors for two isotope ratios such that $\alpha$2/1 = $\alpha$3/1$\beta$. The exponent $\beta$ for equilibrium exchange is (1/m1 − 1/m2)/(1/m1 − 1/m3), where mi are the atomic masses and m1 {\textless} m2 {\textless} m3. For kinetic fractionation, the masses used to evaluate $\beta$ depend upon the isotopic species in motion. Reduced masses apply for breaking bonds whereas molecular or atomic masses apply for transport processes. In each case the functional form of the kinetic $\beta$ is ln(M1/M2)/ln(M1/M3), where Mi are the reduced, molecular, or atomic masses. New high-precision Mg isotope ratio data confirm that the distinct equilibrium and kinetic fractionation laws can be resolved for changes in isotope ratios of only 3‰ per amu. The variability in mass-dependent fractionation laws is sufficient to explain the negative $\Delta$17O of tropospheric O2 relative to rocks and differences in $\Delta$17O between carbonate, hydroxyl, and anhydrous silicate in Martian meteorites. (For simplicity, we use integer amu values for masses when evaluating $\beta$ throughout this paper.)},

These irregularities are caused by events on and within the Earth and provide a means of studying a number of geophysical problems. Seasonal shifts in air masses and variable winds are causes of short-period fluctuations in the rotation. Climatic changes and their attendant sea levels are in part responsible for long-term fluctuations. Modern observations of the Moon and descriptions of ancient elipses both establish a secular increase in the length of day. The interpretation involves atmospheric, oceanic and bodily tides. The book provides a unified treatment of the rotation of the Earth, making this method of studying geophysical phenomena more readily accessible to geophysicists and others.},

abstract = {The surface density profile $\Sigma$(r) of the solar nebula protoplanetary disk is a fundamental input to all models of disk processes and evolution. Traditionally it is estimated by spreading out the augmented masses of the planets over the annuli in which the planets orbit today, the so-called minimum-mass solar nebula. Doing so implicitly assumes that the planets completely accreted all planetesimals in their feeding zones, but this assumption has not been tested. Indeed, models of the growth of Uranus and Neptune predict that these planets could not have grown to {\~{}}10 M⊕ within the lifetime of the disk, even though they must have, to accrete H/He atmospheres. In this paper we adopt the starting positions of the planets in the Nice model of planetary dynamics (Tsiganis and coworkers), in which the solar system started in a much more compact configuration. We derive a surface density profile that is well approximated by the power law $\Sigma$(r) = 343(fp/0.5)-1(r/10 AU)-2.168 g cm-2, where fp is the fraction of the solid mass in the form of planetesimals. We show that this profile is inconsistent with a steady state accretion disk but is consistent with a steady state decretion disk that is being photoevaporated. We calculate the growth of planets in the context of this disk model and demonstrate for the first time that all of the giant planets can achieve their isolation masses and begin to accrete H/He atmospheres within the lifetime of the disk. The fit of our inferred $\Sigma$(r) to the augmented masses of the planets is excellent ({\textless}10{\%}), but only if Uranus and Neptune swtiched places early in the solar system's evolution, a possibility predicted by the Nice model.},

abstract = {The Earth-Moon system likely formed as a result of a collision between two large planetary objects. Debate about their relative masses, the impact energy involved, and the extent of isotopic homogenization continues. We present the results of a high-precision oxygen isotope study of an extensive suite of lunar and terrestrial samples. We demonstrate that lunar rocks and terrestrial basalts show a 3 to 4 ppm (parts per million), statistically resolvable, difference in 17O. Taking aubrite meteorites as a candidate impactor material, we show that the giant impact scenario involved nearly complete mixing between the target and impactor. Alternatively, the degree of similarity between the 17O values of the impactor and the proto-Earth must have been significantly closer than that between Earth and aubrites. If the Earth-Moon system evolved from an initially highly vaporized and isotopically homogenized state, as indicated by recent dynamical models, then the terrestrial basalt-lunar oxygen isotope difference detected by our study may be a reflection of post–giant impact additions to Earth. On the basis of this assumption, our data indicate that post–giant impact additions to Earth could have contributed between 5 and 30{\%} of Earth's water, depending on global water estimates. Consequently, our data indicate that the bulk of Earth's water was accreted before the giant impact and not later, as often proposed.},

abstract = {Recent isotopic studies of Martian meteorites by Dauphas {\&} Pourmand have established that large ({\~{}}3000 km radius) planetary embryos existed in the solar nebula at the same time that chondrules—millimeter-sized igneous inclusions found in meteorites—were forming. We model the formation of chondrules by passage through bow shocks around such a planetary embryo on an eccentric orbit. We numerically model the hydrodynamics of the flow and find that such large bodies retain an atmosphere with Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities allowing mixing of this atmosphere with the gas and particles flowing past the embryo. We calculate the trajectories of chondrules flowing past the body and find that they are not accreted by the protoplanet, but may instead flow through volatiles outgassed from the planet's magma ocean. In contrast, chondrules are accreted onto smaller planetesimals. We calculate the thermal histories of chondrules passing through the bow shock. We find that peak temperatures and cooling rates are consistent with the formation of the dominant, porphyritic texture of most chondrules, assuming a modest enhancement above the likely solar nebula average value of chondrule densities (by a factor of 10), attributable to settling of chondrule precursors to the midplane of the disk or turbulent concentration. We calculate the rate at which a planetary embryo's eccentricity is damped and conclude that a single planetary embryo scattered into an eccentric orbit can, over {\~{}}105 years, produce {\~{}}1024 g of chondrules. In principle, a small number (1-10) of eccentric planetary embryos can melt the observed mass of chondrules in a manner consistent with all known constraints.},

abstract = {Oxygen three-isotope analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry of chondrule olivine and pyroxene in combination with electron microprobe analysis were carried out to investigate 24 FeO-poor (type I) and 2 FeO-rich (type II) chondrules from the Kaba (CV) chondrite. The Mg{\#}'s of olivine and pyroxene in individual chondrules are uniform, which confirms that Kaba is one of the least thermally metamorphosed CV3 chondrites. The majority of chondrules in Kaba contain olivine and pyroxene that show indistinguishable $\Delta$17O values (= $\delta$17O − 0.52 × $\delta$18O) within analytical uncertainties, as revealed by multiple spot analyses of individual chondrules. One third of chondrules contain olivine relict grains that are either16O-rich or16O-poor relative to other indistinguishable olivine and/or pyroxene analyses in the same chondrules. Excluding those isotopically recognized relicts, the mean oxygen isotope ratios ($\delta$18O, $\delta$17O, and $\Delta$17O) of individual chondrules are calculated, which are interpreted to represent those of the final chondrule melt. Most of these isotope ratios plot on or slightly below the primitive chondrule mineral (PCM) line on the oxygen three-isotope diagram, except for the pyroxene-rich type II chondrule that plots above the PCM and on the terrestrial fractionation line. The $\Delta$17O values of type I chondrules range from ∼−8‰ to ∼−4‰; the pyroxene-rich type II chondrule yields ∼0‰ the olivine-rich type II chondrule ∼−2‰. In contrast to the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 094, the Yamato 81020 CO3, and the Allende CV3 chondrite, type I chondrules in Kaba only possess $\Delta$17O values below −3‰ and a pronounced bimodal distribution of $\Delta$17O values, as evident for those other chondrites, was not observed for Kaba. Investigation of the Mg{\#}-$\Delta$17O relationship revealed that $\Delta$17O values tend to increase with decreasing Mg{\#}'s, similar to those observed for CR chondrites though data from Kaba cluster at the high Mg{\#} ({\textgreater}98) and the low $\Delta$17O end (−6‰ and −4‰). A mass balance model involving16O-rich anhydrous dust ($\Delta$17O = −8‰) and16O-poor water ice ($\Delta$17O = +2‰) in the chondrule precursors suggests that type I chondrules in Kaba would have formed in a moderately high dust enriched protoplanetary disk at relatively dry conditions (∼50–100× dust enrichment compared to Solar abundance gas and less than 0.6× ice enhancement relative to CI chondritic dust). The olivine-rich type II chondrule probably formed in a disk with higher dust enrichment (∼2000× Solar).},

abstract = {The depletion pattern of volatile elements on Earth and other differentiated terrestrial bodies provides a unique insight as to the nature and origin of planetary building blocks. The processes responsible for the depletion of volatile elements range from the early incomplete condensation in the solar nebula to the late de-volatilization induced by heating and impacting during planetary accretion after the dispersion of the H2-rich nebular gas. Furthermore, as many volatile elements are also siderophile (metal-loving), it is often difficult to deconvolve the effect of volatility from core formation. With the notable exception of the Earth, all the differentiated terrestrial bodies for which we have samples have non-chondritic Mn/Na ratios, taken as a signature of post-nebular volatilization. The bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is unique in that its Mn/Na ratio is chondritic, which points to a nebular origin for the depletion; unless the Mn/Na in the BSE is not that of the bulk Earth (BE), and has been affected by core formation through the partitioning of Mn in Earth's core. Here we quantify the metal–silicate partitioning behavior of Mn at deep magma ocean pressure and temperature conditions directly applicable to core formation. The experiments show that Mn becomes more siderophile with increasing pressure and temperature. Modeling the partitioning of Mn during core formation by combining our results with previous data at lower P–T conditions, we show that the core likely contains a significant fraction (20 to 35{\%}) of Earth's Mn budget. However, we show that the derived Mn/Na value of the bulk Earth still lies on the volatile-depleted end of a trend defined by chondritic meteorites in a Mn/Na vs Mn/Mg plot, which tend to higher Mn/Na with increasing volatile depletion. This suggests that the material that formed the Earth recorded similar chemical fractionation processes for moderately volatile elements as chondrites in the solar nebula, and experienced limited post nebular volatilization.},

abstract = {This work revisits the hypothesis of the so-called ‘lunar terminal cataclysm' suggested by Tera et al. (1973, 1974) as a strong peak in the meteorite bombardment of the Moon around 3.9 Ga ago. According to the hypothesis, most of the impact craters observed on the lunar highlands formed during this short time period and thus formed the majority of the lunar highland impact breccias and melts. The hypothesis arose from the observation that the ages of highland samples from all the lunar missions are mostly grouped around 3.9–4.0 Ga. Since those missions, however, radiometric dating techniques have progressed and many samples, both old and new, have been re-analyzed. Nevertheless, the debate over whether there was a terminal cataclysm persists. To progress in this problem we summarized results of 269 K–Ar datings (mostly made using the40Ar–39Ar technique) of highland rocks represented by the Apollo 14, 15, 16, 17 and Luna 20 samples and 94 datings of clasts of the highland rocks from 23 lunar meteorites representing 21 localities on the lunar surface, and considered them jointly with the results of our modelling of the cumulative effect of the impact gardening process on the presence of impact melt of different ages at the near-surface of the Moon. The considered results of K–Ar dating of the Apollo-Luna samples of lunar highland rocks confirmed a presence of strong peak centered at 3.87 Ga. But since the time when the hypothesis of terminal cataclysm was suggested, it has become clear that this peak could be a result of sampling bias: it is the only prominent feature at the sites with an apparent domination of Imbrium basin ejecta (Apollo 14 and 15) and the age pattern is more complicated for the sites influenced not only by Imbrium ejecta but also that of other basins (Nectaris at the Apollo 16 site and Serenitatis at the Apollo 17 site). Our modelling shows that the cataclysm, if it occurred, should produce a strong peak in the measured age values but we see in the considered histograms and relative probability plots not only the 3.87 Ga peak (due to Imbrium basin), but also several secondary peaks caused by the formation of other basins distributed between 3.87 and 4.25 Ga. The lunar terminal cataclysm hypothesis is in disagreement with the distribution of K–Ar ages for the highland rocks of the lunar meteorites. The population of lunar meteorites representing localities randomly distributed over the lunar surface, and thus free from the mentioned sampling bias, shows no ∼3.9 Ga peak as it should, if the cataclysm did occur. We conclude that the statistics of sample ages contradict the terminal cataclysm scenario in the bombardment of the Moon. We also see evidence for the formation of several impact basins between 3.87 and 4.25 Ga which is likewise incompatible with the hypothesis of a short interval cataclysm. There remain other basins, including the largest South Pole – Aitken, the ages of which should be determined in future studies to further clarify the impact history. Sample-return missions targeted to date several key basins need to be planned, and the continued study of lunar meteorites may also bring new details to the general view of the impact bombardment of the Moon.},

abstract = {Chondrules, mm-sized igneous-textured spherules, are the dominant bulk silicate constituent of chondritic meteorites and originate from highly energetic, local processes during the first million years after the birth of the Sun. So far, an astrophysically consistent chondrule formation scenario explaining major chemical, isotopic and textural features, in particular Fe,Ni metal abundances, bulk Fe/Mg ratios and intra-chondrite chemical and isotopic diversity, remains elusive. Here, we examine the prospect of forming chondrules from impact splashes among planetesimals heated by radioactive decay of short-lived radionuclides using thermomechanical models of their interior evolution. We show that intensely melted planetesimals with interior magma oceans became rapidly chemically equilibrated and physically differentiated. Therefore, collisional interactions among such bodies would have resulted in chondrule-like but basaltic spherules, which are not observed in the meteoritic record. This inconsistency with the expected dynamical interactions hints at an incomplete understanding of the planetary growth regime during the lifetime of the solar protoplanetary disk. To resolve this conundrum, we examine how the observed chemical and isotopic features of chondrules constrain the dynamical environment of accreting chondrite parent bodies by interpreting the meteoritic record as an impact-generated proxy of early solar system planetesimals that underwent repeated collision and reaccretion cycles. Using a coupled evolution-collision model we demonstrate that the vast majority of collisional debris feeding the asteroid main belt must be derived from planetesimals which were partially molten at maximum. Therefore, the precursors of chondrite parent bodies either formed primarily small, from sub-canonical aluminum-26 reservoirs, or collisional destruction mechanisms were efficient enough to shatter planetesimals before they reached the magma ocean phase. Finally, we outline the window in parameter space for which chondrule formation from planetesimal collisions can be reconciled with the meteoritic record and how our results can be used to further constrain early solar system dynamics.},

abstract = {Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth and in chondrites and is a pure lithophile element which does not partition into planetary cores. Therefore, the calcium isotopic composition of the mantle represents the bulk Earth and calcium isotopes have the potential to reveal genetic links between Earth and meteorites. However, whether calcium exhibits significant mass-dependent variations among Earth and the various chondrite groups, and the magnitude of these variations, is still contentious. Here we have developed a new method to analyze calcium isotope ratios with high precision using multiple-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry. The method has been applied to a range of terrestrial and meteoritic samples. We find that the Earth, the Moon, and the aubrite parent body are indistinguishable from enstatite, ordinary, and CO chondritic meteorites. Therefore, enstatite chondrites cannot be excluded as components of Earth's building blocks based on calcium isotopes, as has been proposed previously. In contrast, CI, CV, CM and CR carbonaceous chondrites are largely enriched in lighter calcium isotopes compared to Earth, and, overall, exhibit a wide range in calcium isotopic composition. Calcium is the only major element, along with oxygen, for which isotopic variations are observed among carbonaceous chondrite groups. These calcium isotope variations cannot be attributed to volatility effects, and it is difficult to ascribe them to the abundance of isotopically light refractory inclusions. The calcium isotope data presented in this study suggest that both ordinary and enstatite chondrites are representative of the bulk of the refractory materials that formed Earth. On the basis of calcium isotopes, carbonaceous chondrites (with the exception of CO) are not representative of the fraction of condensable material that accreted to form the terrestrial planets and can be excluded as unique contenders for the building blocks of Earth; however, on the basis of other isotopic systems, CO chondrites can be excluded as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the solar system giant planets come in two flavours: gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) with massive gas envelopes, and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) with much thinner envelopes around their cores. It is poorly understood how these two classes of planets formed. High solid accretion rates, necessary to form the cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs, heat the envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unless accretion is halted. We find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles ({\~{}}cm sized particles) is self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gap in the pebble disc. This halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers the rapid collapse of the super-critical gas envelope. Unlike gas giants, ice giants do not reach this threshold mass and can only bind low-mass envelopes that are highly enriched by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles. This offers an explanation for the compositional difference between gas giants and ice giants in the solar system. Furthermore, unlike planetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model allows core formation and envelope attraction within disc life-times, provided that solids in protoplanetary discs are predominantly made up of pebbles. Our results imply that the outer regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to halt pebble accretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant exoplanets in wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 Earth masses of solids.},

An improved method for the chemical purification of Rb for high-precision isotope ratio measurements by multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry. This method has been used to measure the Rb isotopic composition for a suite of planetary materials, including carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondrites, as well as achondrites (eucrite, angrite), terrestrial igneous rocks (basalt, andesite, granite), and Apollo lunar samples (mare basalts, alkali suite). Volatile depleted bodies (e.g. HED parent body, thermally metamorphosed meteorites) are enriched in the heavy isotope of Rb by up to several per mil compared to chondrites, suggesting volatile loss by evaporation at the surface of planetesimals. In addition, the Moon is isotopically distinct from the Moon in Rb. The variations in Rb isotope compositions in the volatile-poor samples are attributed to volatile loss from planetesimals during accretion. This suggests that either the Rb (and other volatile elements) were lost during or following the giant impact or by evaporation earlier during the accretion history of Theia.},

The Moon and Earth are chemically and isotopically very similar. However, the Moon is highly depleted in volatile elements and the origin of this depletion is still debated. We present gallium isotopic and elemental measurements in a large set of lunar samples to constrain the origin of this volatile depletion. We show that while Ga has a geochemical behavior different from zinc, both elements show a systematic enrichment in the heavier isotopes in lunar mare basalts and Mg-suite rocks compared to the silicate Earth, pointing to a global-scale depletion event. On the other hand, the ferroan anorthosites are isotopically het-erogeneous, suggesting a secondary distribution of Ga at the surface of the Moon by volatilization and condensa-tion. The isotopic difference of Ga between Earth and the Moon and the isotopic heterogeneity of the crustal ferroan anorthosites suggest that the volatile depletion occurred following the giant impact and during the lunar magma ocean phase. These results point toward a Moon that has lost its volatile elements during a whole-scale evaporation event and that is now relatively dry compared to Earth.},

We find that ferroan anorthosites are isotopically heterogeneous, with some samples exhibiting high $\delta$(66)Zn, along with alkali and magnesian suite samples. Since the plutonic samples were formed in the lunar crust, they were not subjected to degassing into vacuum. Instead, their compositions are consistent with enrichment of the silicate portions of the Moon in the heavier Zn isotopes. Because of the difference in $\delta$(66)Zn between bulk silicate Earth and lunar basalts and crustal rocks, the volatile loss likely occurred in two stages: during the proto-lunar disk stage, where a fraction of lunar volatiles accreted onto Earth, and from degassing of a differentiating lunar magma ocean, implying the possibility of isolated, volatile-rich regions in the Moon's interior.},

abstract = {The thermophysical properties of molten silicates at extreme conditions are crucial for understanding the early evolution of Earth and other massive rocky planets, which is marked by giant impacts capable of producing deep magma oceans. Cooling and crystallization of molten mantles are sensitive to the densities and adiabatic profiles of high-pressure molten silicates, demanding accurate Equation of State (EOS) models to predict the early evolution of planetary interiors. Unfortunately, EOS modeling for liquids at high P-T conditions is difficult due to constantly evolving liquid structure. The Rosenfeld-Tarazona (RT) model provides a physically sensible and accurate description of liquids but is limited to constant volume heating paths (Rosenfeld and Tarazona, 1998). We develop a high P-T EOS for liquids, called RTpress, which uses a generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona model as a thermal perturbation to isothermal and adiabatic reference compression curves. This approach provides a thermodynamically consistent EOS which remains accurate over a large P-T range and depends on a limited number of physically meaningful parameters that can be determined empirically from either simulated or experimental datasets. As a first application, we model MgSiO3 melt representing a simplified rocky mantle chemistry. The model parameters are fitted to the MD simulations of both Spera et al. (Mar. 2011) and de and Stixrude (2009), recovering pressures, volumes, and internal energies to within 0.6 GPa, 0.1 {\AA}3, and 6 meV per atom on average (for the higher resolution data set), as well as accurately predicting liquid densities and temperatures from shock-wave experiments on MgSiO3 glass. The fitted EOS is used to determine adiabatic thermal profiles, revealing the approximate thermal structure of a fully molten magma ocean like that of the early Earth. These adiabats, which are in strong agreement for both fitted models, are shown to be sufficiently steep to produce either a center-outwards or bottom-up style of crystallization, depending on the curvature of the mantle melting curve (liquidus), with a high-curvature model yielding crystallization at depths of roughly 80 GPa (Stixrude et al., Feb. 2009) whereas a nearly-flat experimentally determined liquidus implies bottom-up crystallization (Andrault et al., Apr. 2011).},

abstract = {It has been suggested that thin Keplerian disks, like rotating stars, cannot attain hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium simultaneously if the angular velocity is a function of radius only. To address the problem of vertical structure and stability of thin accretion disks, we performed 2D axisymmetric calculations by solving the set of fully nonlinear hydrodynamic equations, including radiation transport. The results indicate that the variation of the rotational velocity with height is too small to sustain hydrostatic equilibrium. Instead, the variation of the radial (inflow) velocity with height suffices to establish a stationary state. In particular, we find that for low values of the viscosity parameter alpha, there is mass outflow in the central parts of the disk close to the equatorial plane, and inflow only near the surface. Only for modestly high values of alpha, the flow throughout the disk is directed inward. Thus, the flow within the disk is the result of viscous radial inflow plus a circulatory flow directed outward in the midplane and inward near the surface.},

@article{Huguet2018,
abstract = {The conventional view of Earth's inner core is that it began to crystallize at Earth's center when the temperature dropped below the melting point of the iron alloy and has grown steadily since that time as the core continued to cool. However, this model neglects the energy barrier to the formation of the first stable crystal nucleus, which is commonly represented in terms of the critical supercooling required to overcome the barrier. Using constraints from experiments, simulations, and theory, we show that spontaneous crystallization in a homogeneous liquid iron alloy at Earth's core pressures requires a critical supercooling of order 1000 K, which is too large to be a plausible mechanism for the origin of Earth's inner core. We consider mechanisms that can lower the nucleation barrier substantially. Each has caveats, yet the inner core exists: this is the nucleation paradox. Heterogeneous nucleation on a solid metallic substrate tends to have a low energy barrier and offers the most straightforward solution to the paradox, but solid metal would probably have to be delivered from the mantle and such events are unlikely to have been common. A delay in nucleation, whether due to a substantial nucleation energy barrier, or late introduction of a low energy substrate, would lead to an initial phase of rapid inner core growth from a supercooled state. Such rapid growth may lead to distinctive crystallization texturing that might be observable seismically. It would also generate a spike in chemical and thermal buoyancy that could affect the geomagnetic field significantly. Solid metal introduced to Earth's center before it reached saturation could also provide a nucleation substrate, if large enough to escape complete dissolution. Inner core growth, in this case, could begin earlier and start more slowly than standard thermal models predict.},

abstract = {Giant impacts (GIs) are common in the late stage of planet formation. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is widely used for simulating the outcome of such violent collisions, one prominent example being the formation of the Moon. However, a decade of numerical studies in various areas of computational astrophysics have shown that the standard formulation of SPH suffers from several shortcomings, for example, its inability to capture subsonic turbulence, which can suppress mixing when two different fluids come into contact. In order to quantify how severe are these limitations when modeling GIs we did a comparison of simulations with identical initial conditions run with the standard SPH and a novel Lagrangian Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) method. We confirm the lack of mixing between the impactor and target when SPH is employed, while MFM is capable of driving turbulence and leads to significant mixing between the two bodies. Modern SPH variants with artificial conductivity, different formulation of the hydro force or reduced artificial viscosity, do not improve as significanyly, and their initial conditions suffer from resolving density discontinuity at the core-mantle boundary.},

abstract = {Calculation of the volume and composition of magma generated by lithospheric extension requires an accurate mitial geotherm, and knowledge of the variation and composition of the melt fraction as a function of pressure and temperature. The relevant geophysical observations are outlined, and geotherms then obtained from parameterized convective models. Experimental observations which constrain the solidus and liquidus at various pressures are described by simple empirical functions. The variation in melt fraction is then parameterized by requiring a variation from 0 on the solidus to 1 on the liquidus. The composition of the melts is principally controlled by the melt fraction, though those of FeO, MgO, and SiO2 in addition vary with pressure. Another simple parameterization allows the observed compositions of major elements in 91 experiments to be calculated with a mean error of 1.1{\%}, and those of TiO2 and Na2O to 0.3{\%}. These expressions are then used to calculate the expected compositions of magma produced by adiabatic upwelling. The mean major element composition of the most magnesium-rich MORB glasses resemble the mean composition calculated for a mantle potential temperature Tp of 1280°C. Adiabatic melting during upwelling of mantle of this temperature generates a melt thickness of 7 km. The observed variations of the MgO and TiO2 concentrations in a large collection of MORB glass compositions suggest that extensive low pressure fractional crystallization occurs, but that its effect on the concentrations of SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO is small. There is no evidence that normal oceanic crust is produced from magmas containing more than 11{\%} MgO. The mantle potential temperature within hot rising jets is about 1480°C and can generate 27 km of magma containing 17{\%} MgO. Extension of the continental lithosphere generates little melt unless {\{}beta{\}}{\textgreater} 2 and Tp{\textgreater} 1380°C. The melts generated by larger values of {\{}beta{\}} or of Tp are alkali basalts, and change to tholeiites as the amount of melting increases. Large quantities of melt can be generated, especially at continental margins, where estimates of {\{}beta{\}} obtained from changes in crustal thickness will in general be too small.},

Analytic determinations of tidal dissipation in a homogeneous, incompressible Moon and in a two-layer Moon with a soft core and rigid mantle are given as a function of position in the Moon and as a function of Earth-Moon separation. The most recent information on the historical values of the lunar obliquity is employed, and we present results for the constant values of orbital eccentricity of e = 0.0 and e = 0.055. For a simplified orbital evolution and a dissipation factor Q = 100, the total increase in the mean lunar temperature for the homogeneous case does not exceed several tens of degrees. For the two-layer models the local dissipation may be enhanced over that of the homogeneous Moon by a factor of 5 for a core radius of 0.5 lunar radii and by a factor of 100 for a core radius of 0.95 lunar radii. The corresponding factors for the total dissipation are 3 and 15 for the two values of core radii, respectively. We conclude that tidal contributions to lunar thermal history are probably not important. But under special circumstances the enhanced dissipation in a two-layer Moon could have led to a spectacular thermal event. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Melting of H2O ice during planetary impact events is a widespread phenomenon. On planetary surfaces, ice is often mixed with other materials; yet, at present, the partitioning of energy between the components of a shocked mixture is still an open question in the shock physics community. Knowledge of how much energy is partitioned into the ice component is necessary to predict and interpret a wide range of processes, including shock-induced melting and chemistry. In this work, we construct a conceptual framework for the thermodynamic pathways of the components in a shocked hydrodynamic mixture by defining three broad regimes based on the characteristic length scale of the mixture compared to the thickness of the shock front: (1) small length scale mixtures where pressure and temperature equilibrate immediately behind the shock front; (2) intermediate length scales where pressure but not thermal equilibration is achieved behind the shock front; and (3) long length scales where pressure equilibration requires multiple shock wave reflections. We conduct shock wave experiments, reaching pressures from 8 to 23 GPa, in an H2O ice-SiO2 quartz mixture in the intermediate length scale regime. In each experiment, all the parameters required to address the question of energy partitioning were determined: the shock velocity in the mixture, the shock front thickness, and the shock and post-shock temperatures of the H2O component. The measured pressure is in agreement with the bulk compressibility of the mixture. The shock and post-shock temperatures of the H2O component indicate that the ice was shocked close to the principal Hugoniot. Therefore, in the intermediate length scale regime, the partitioning of shock energy is defined initially by the Hugoniots of the components at the equilibrated pressure. We discuss energy partitioning in mixtures over the wide range of length and time scales encountered during planetary impact events and identify the current challenges in calculating the volume of melted ice. In some cases, the criteria for shock-induced melting of ice in a mixture are the same as for pure ice. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). The effect of grain size and moisture content on the dynamic macroscopic response of granular geological materials was explored by performing uniaxial planar impact experiments on high purity, Oklahoma {\#}1, sand samples composed of either fine (75-150 $\mu$m) or coarse (425-500 $\mu$m) grain sizes in either dry or fully water-saturated conditions. Oklahoma {\#}1 sand was chosen for its smooth, quasi-spherical grain shapes, narrow grain size distributions, and nearly pure SiO 2 composition (99.8 wt. {\%}). The water-saturated samples were completely saturated ensuring a two-phase mixture with roughly 65{\%} sand and 35{\%} water. Sand samples were dynamically loaded to pressures between 1 and 11 GPa. Three-dimensional meso-scale simulations using an Eulerian hydrocode, CTH, were created to model the response of each sand sample. Multi-phase equations of state were used for both silicon dioxide, which comprised individual sand grains, and water, which surrounded individual grains. Particle velocity profiles measured from the rear surface of the sand, both experimentally and computationally, reveal that fine grain samples have steeper rise characteristics than coarse grain samples and water-saturated samples have an overall much stiffer response than dry samples. The experimentally determined particle velocity vs. shock velocity response of dry sand was linear over this pressure range, with little difference between the two grain sizes investigated. The experimental response for the water saturated sand exhibited a piecewise continuous response with a transition region between particle velocities of 0.6 km s -1 and 0.8 km s -1 and a pressure of 4.5-6 GPa. Hypotheses for the cause of this transition region are drawn based on results of the meso-scale simulations.},

abstract = {The volatile element depletion patterns of planetary size objects and the chemical and isotopic composition of numerous smaller objects such as chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) provide the motivation to consider evaporation and condensation processes in the early solar system. Equilibrium thermodynamic calculations of condensation of phases in the solar nebula provide an important reference with which natural solar system materials can be compared. The theoretical background for fractionation of elemental and isotopic compositions during kinetically controlled evaporation and condensation is explored in some detail. Some parameters can be calculated from first principles, but others must be measured in the laboratory, and a number of evaporation experiments are described and interpreted. Elemental and isotopic fractionations of solar system materials are then intepreted in the context of the theoretical and experimental considerations. A key point is that the processes that led to chondrules and planets appear to have occurred under conditions very close to equilibrium, whereas the processes that led to CAIs involved significant departures from equilibrium. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies are powerful tracers to determine the provenance of meteorites and their components, and to identify genetic links between these materials. Here we show that chondrules and matrix separated from the Allende CV3 chondrite have complementary nucleosynthetic Mo isotope anomalies. These anomalies result from the enrichment of a presolar carrier enriched in s-process Mo into the matrix, and the corresponding depletion of this carrier in the chondrules. This carrier most likely is a metal and so the uneven distribution of presolar material probably results from metal–silicate fractionation during chondrule formation. The Mo isotope anomalies correlate with those reported for W isotopes on the same samples in an earlier study, suggesting that the isotope variations for both Mo and W are caused by the heterogeneous distribution of the same carrier. The isotopic complementary of chondrules and matrix indicates that both components are genetically linked and formed together from one common reservoir of solar nebula dust. As such, the isotopic data require that most chondrules formed in the solar nebula and are not a product of protoplanetary impacts. Allende chondrules and matrix together with bulk carbonaceous chondrites and some iron meteorites (groups IID, IIIF, and IVB) show uniform excesses in92Mo,95Mo, and97Mo that result from the addition of supernova material to the solar nebula region in which these carbonaceous meteorites formed. Non-carbonaceous meteorites (enstatite and ordinary chondrites as well as most iron meteorites) do not contain this material, demonstrating that two distinct Mo isotope reservoirs co-existed in the early solar nebula that remained spatially separated for several million years. This separation was most likely achieved through the formation of the gas giants, which cleared the disk between the inner and outer solar system regions parental to the non-carbonaceous and carbonaceous meteorites. The Mo isotope dichotomy of meteorites provides a new means to determine the provenance of meteoritic and planetary materials, and to assess genetic links between chondrites and differentiated meteorites.},

abstract = {Earth owes its oxygenated atmosphere to its unique claim on life, but how the atmosphere evolved from an initially oxygen-free state remains unresolved. The rise of atmospheric oxygen occurred in two stages: approximately 2.5 to 2.0 billion years ago during the Great Oxidation Event and roughly 2 billion years later during the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event. We propose that the formation of continents about 2.7 to 2.5 billion years ago, perhaps due to the initiation of plate tectonics, may have led to oxygenation by the following mechanisms. In the first stage, the change in composition of Earth's crust from iron- and magnesium-rich mafic rocks to feldspar- and quartz-rich felsic rocks could have caused a decrease in the oxidative efficiency of the Earth's surface, allowing atmospheric O2 to rise. Over the next billion years, as carbon steadily accumulated on the continents, metamorphic and magmatic reactions within this growing continental carbon reservoir facilitated a gradual increase in the total long-term input of CO2 to the ocean-atmosphere system. Given that O2 is produced during organic carbon burial, the increased CO2 input may have triggered a second rise in O2. A two-step rise in atmospheric O2 may therefore be a natural consequence of plate tectonics, continent formation and the growth of a crustal carbon reservoir.},

The temperature results are used to validate the new 5-Phase H2O model equation of state (EOS). The 5-Phase EOS is used to predict the critical shock pressures required to induce melting and vaporization of ice for a wide range of ambient pressures and temperatures. Impact events with velocities as low as 1 km/s will initiate phase changes on icy surfaces. Thus, shock-induced melting and vaporization of ice is a widespread process in the solar system},

abstract = {Knowledge of melting properties is critical to predict the nature and the fate of melts produced in the deep mantle. Early in the Earth's history, melting properties controlled the magma ocean crystallization, which potentially induced chemical segregation in distinct reservoirs. Today, partial melting most probably occurs in the lowermost mantle as well as at mid upper-mantle depths, which control important aspects of mantle dynamics, including some types of volcanism. Unfortunately, despite major experimental and theoretical efforts, major controversies remain about several aspects of mantle melting. For example, the liquidus of the mantle was reported (for peridotitic or chondritic-type composition) with a temperature difference of ∼1000K at high mantle depths. Also, the Fe partitioning coefficient (DFeBg/melt) between bridgmanite (Bg, the major lower mantle mineral) and a melt was reported between ∼0.1 and ∼0.5, for a mantle depth of ∼2000km. Until now, these uncertainties had prevented the construction of a coherent picture of the melting behavior of the deep mantle. In this article, we perform a critical review of previous works and develop a coherent, semi-quantitative, model. We first address the melting curve of Bg with the help of original experimental measurements, which yields a constraint on the volume change upon melting ($\Delta$Vm). Secondly, we apply a basic thermodynamical approach to discuss the melting behavior of mineralogical assemblages made of fractions of Bg, CaSiO3-perovskite and (Mg,Fe)O-ferropericlase. Our analysis yields quantitative constraints on the SiO2-content in the pseudo-eutectic melt and the degree of partial melting (F) as a function of pressure, temperature and mantle composition; For examples, we find that F could be more than 40{\%} at the solidus temperature, except if the presence of volatile elements induces incipient melting. We then discuss the melt buoyancy in a partial molten lower mantle as a function of pressure, F and DFeBg/melt. In the lower mantle, density inversions (i.e. sinking melts) appear to be restricted to low F values and highest mantle pressures. The coherent melting model has direct geophysical implications: (i) in the early Earth, the magma ocean crystallization could not occur for a core temperature higher than ∼5400K at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). This temperature corresponds to the melting of pure Bg at 135GPa. For a mantle composition more realistic than pure Bg, the right CMB temperature for magma ocean crystallization could have been as low as ∼4400K. (ii) There are converging arguments for the formation of a relatively homogeneous mantle after magma ocean crystallization. In particular, we predict the bulk crystallization of a relatively large mantle fraction, when the temperature becomes lower than the pseudo-eutectic temperature. Some chemical segregation could still be possible as a result of some Bg segregation in the lowermost mantle during the first stage of the magma ocean crystallization, and due to a much later descent of very low F, Fe-enriched, melts toward the CMB. (iii) The descent of such melts could still take place today. There formation should to be related to incipient mantle melting due to the presence of volatile elements. Even though, these melts can only be denser than the mantle (at high mantle depths) if the controversial value of DFeBg/melt is indeed as low as suggested by some experimental studies. This type of melts could contribute to produce ultra-low seismic velocity anomalies in the lowermost mantle.},

abstract = {Melting of H2O ice during planetary impact events is a widespread phenomenon. On planetary surfaces, ice is often mixed with other materials; yet, at present, the partitioning of energy between the components of a shocked mixture is still an open question in the shock physics community. Knowledge of how much energy is partitioned into the ice component is necessary to predict and interpret a wide range of processes, including shock-induced melting and chemistry. In this work, we construct a conceptual framework for the thermodynamic pathways of the components in a shocked hydrodynamic mixture by defining three broad regimes based on the characteristic length scale of the mixture compared to the thickness of the shock front: (1) small length scale mixtures where pressure and temperature equilibrate immediately behind the shock front; (2) intermediate length scales where pressure but not thermal equilibration is achieved behind the shock front; and (3) long length scales where pressure equilibration requires multiple shock wave reflections. We conduct shock wave experiments, reaching pressures from 8 to 23 GPa, in an H2O ice-SiO2 quartz mixture in the intermediate length scale regime. In each experiment, all the parameters required to address the question of energy partitioning were determined: the shock velocity in the mixture, the shock front thickness, and the shock and post-shock temperatures of the H2O component. The measured pressure is in agreement with the bulk compressibility of the mixture. The shock and post-shock temperatures of the H2O component indicate that the ice was shocked close to the principal Hugoniot. Therefore, in the intermediate length scale regime, the partitioning of shock energy is defined initially by the Hugoniots of the components at the equilibrated pressure. We discuss energy partitioning in mixtures over the wide range of length and time scales encountered during planetary impact events and identify the current challenges in calculating the volume of melted ice. In some cases, the criteria for shock-induced melting of ice in a mixture are the same as for pure ice. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). The effect of grain size and moisture content on the dynamic macroscopic response of granular geological materials was explored by performing uniaxial planar impact experiments on high purity, Oklahoma {\#}1, sand samples composed of either fine (75-150 $\mu$m) or coarse (425-500 $\mu$m) grain sizes in either dry or fully water-saturated conditions. Oklahoma {\#}1 sand was chosen for its smooth, quasi-spherical grain shapes, narrow grain size distributions, and nearly pure SiO 2 composition (99.8 wt. {\%}). The water-saturated samples were completely saturated ensuring a two-phase mixture with roughly 65{\%} sand and 35{\%} water. Sand samples were dynamically loaded to pressures between 1 and 11 GPa. Three-dimensional meso-scale simulations using an Eulerian hydrocode, CTH, were created to model the response of each sand sample. Multi-phase equations of state were used for both silicon dioxide, which comprised individual sand grains, and water, which surrounded individual grains. Particle velocity profiles measured from the rear surface of the sand, both experimentally and computationally, reveal that fine grain samples have steeper rise characteristics than coarse grain samples and water-saturated samples have an overall much stiffer response than dry samples. The experimentally determined particle velocity vs. shock velocity response of dry sand was linear over this pressure range, with little difference between the two grain sizes investigated. The experimental response for the water saturated sand exhibited a piecewise continuous response with a transition region between particle velocities of 0.6 km s -1 and 0.8 km s -1 and a pressure of 4.5-6 GPa. Hypotheses for the cause of this transition region are drawn based on results of the meso-scale simulations.},

abstract = {We present a new quantitative framework to understand the process of mantle melting based on the velocity structure of igneous crust. Our approach focuses on the lower crustal section, which is expected to be least affected by porosity and seawater alteration, especially for thick igneous crust. Our methodology is thus best for constraining the origin of large igneous provinces. First, a quantitative relation between bulk crustal velocity and mantle melting parameters is established on the basis of data from mantle melting experiments. Second, we show how lower crustal velocity can be used to place bounds on the expected range of bulk crustal velocity, despite ambiguity in crustal emplacement processes. By modeling fractional crystallization processes at a range of crustal pressures, these bounds are derived as a function of the proportion of lower versus upper crust. Finally, a simple mantle melting model is constructed to illustrate the effects of potential temperature, active upwelling, and a preexisting lithospheric lid on predicted crustal thickness and velocity. As an example, this new interpretation is applied to a seismic transect across the southeast Greenland margin to constrain mantle dynamics during the opening of the North Atlantic. Some complicating factors in seismological inference on mantle melting process, such as the possibilities of subcrustal igneous fractionation and mantle source heterogeneity, are also discussed with this example.},

The current suite of models allows for both circular and eccentric orbits in conjunction with photometric effects, such as the primary transit and secondary eclipse, reflected light, thermal emissions, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler beaming and superrotation. We discuss our new efforts to expand the capabilities of the software to include more subtle photometric effects involving reflected and refracted light. We discuss the EXONEST inference engine design and introduce our plans to port the current MATLAB-based EXONEST software package over to the next generation Exoplanetary Explorer, which will be a Python-based open source project with the capability to employ third-party plug-and-play models of exoplanet-related photometric effects.},

Adding solids at a rate {\$}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\$} enables the system to find an equilibrium where the mass in solids is roughly constant. This equilibrium depends on {\$}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\$} and {\$}r{\_}0{\$}, the radius of the largest solid added to the swarm. When {\$}r{\_}0 \backslashlesssim{\$} 10 km, this equilibrium is stable. For larger {\$}r{\_}0{\$}, the mass oscillates between high and low states; the fraction of time spent in high states ranges from 100{\%} for large {\$}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\$} to much less than 1{\%} for small {\$}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\$}. During high states, the stellar luminosity reprocessed by the solids is comparable to the excess infrared emission observed in many metallic line white dwarfs.},

abstract = {The most abundant components of primitive meteorites (chondrites) are millimeter-sized glassy spherical chondrules formed by transient melting events in the solar protoplanetary disk. Using Pb-Pb dates of 22 individual chondrules, we show that primary production of chondrules in the early solar system was restricted to the first million years after formation of the Sun and that these existing chondrules were recycled for the remaining lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. This is consistent with a primary chondrule formation episode during the early high-mass accretion phase of the protoplanetary disk that transitions into a longer period of chondrule reworking. An abundance of chondrules at early times provides the precursor material required to drive the efficient and rapid formation of planetary objects via chondrule accretion.},

abstract = {Overabundances in highly siderophile elements (HSEs) of Earth's mantle can be explained by conveyance from a singular, immense (D ∼ 3000 km) " Late Veneer " impactor of chondritic composition, subsequent to lunar formation and terrestrial core-closure. Such rocky objects of approximately lunar mass (∼0.01 M ⊕) ought to be differentiated, such that nearly all of their HSE payload is sequestered into iron cores. Here, we analyze the mechanical and chemical fate of the core of such a Late Veneer impactor, and trace how its HSEs are suspended – and thus pollute – the mantle. For the statistically most-likely oblique collision (∼45 •), the impactor's core elongates and thereafter disintegrates into a metallic hail of small particles (∼10 m). Some strike the orbiting Moon as sesquinary impactors, but most re-accrete to Earth as secondaries with further fragmentation. We show that a single oblique impactor provides an adequate amount of HSEs to the primordial terrestrial silicate reservoirs via oxidation of ({\textless}m-sized) metal particles with a hydrous, pre-impact, early Hadean Earth.},

abstract = {Kinetics of evaporation of forsterite in hydrogen gas was investigated by high temperature vacuum experiments in the pressure range plausible for the solar nebula. The evaporation rate at total pressure (Ptot) below 10-6 bar is nearly constant and is similar to that in vacuum, whereas the rate at 10-6 to 10-3 bar is dependent on Ptot. The evaporation rate, JFoexp, is fitted by JFoexp = 1.72P1.19tot + 9.87 × 10-7 (g{\textperiodcentered}cm-2{\textperiodcentered}s-1) for Ptot below 10-4 bar. The condensation coefficient, $\alpha$, which is a factor related to kinetics of surface reactions, is evaluated by using the Hertz-Knudsen equation for the kinetic theory of gas molecules. The ratio of the experimentally obtained evaporation rate to that calculated from chemical equilibrium in the system Mg2SiO4-H2 gives the a value of 0.06 in vacuum, which increases up to 0.2 with increasing Ptot from 10-3 to 10-4 bar. The apparent increase of forsterite evaporation rate with increasing H2 abundance is due mainly to increase of the equilibrium vapor pressure, which corresponds to increase in the driving force, and partly to increase in a (reduction of the kinetic barrier) for evaporation. The experimental results were applied to understand behavior of forsterite dusts with time in an abruptly heated model nebula mostly comprising forsterite and H2. The nebular system can be divided into complete and partial evaporation regimes, which is defined by a dust enrichment factor. For the complete evaporation regime (low dust enrichment), the minimum time for forsterite grains to totally evaporate is estimated as a function of total pressure, temperature, and initial grain size. The lifetime of forsterite grains ({\textless}10 $\mu$m in size) could be less than 1 h at 1700°C. The experimental results were further applied to examine the possibility of isotopic fractionation for forsterite grains in the solar nebula. By evaluating the competition between evaporation from surface and elemental diffusion in forsterite, it is shown that forsterite grains could have isotopically fractionated to be heavier only for Mg, but not for Si and O.},

abstract = {Low-pressure phase relations and vapor pressures of forsterite and fayalite were studied with the Knudsen method in the temperature range of 1400-1860°C for forsterite and 1100-1160°C for fayalite. The triple points are 5.2 × 10-5 bar (1890°C) and 6.3 × 10-8 bar (1217°C) for forsterite and fayalite, respectively. The enthalpy and entropy of evaporation of forsterite are $\Delta$Hv = 543 ± 33 kJ/mol and $\Delta$Sv = 169 ± 21 J/(mol{\textperiodcentered}K), and those for fayalite are 502 ± 9 kJ/mol and 199 ± 6 J/(mol{\textperiodcentered}K), respectively. By assuming that gas and olivine are ideal solutions, vaporous and solidus curves of the olivine solid solution system in the pressure range from 10-10 to 10-3 bar were calculated from the thermochemical data. At pressures above the triple point of forsterite, the phase diagram is the same as that at 1 bar, because the vapor field is at higher temperatures than those of liquid-bearing fields. At pressures between the triple points of forsterite and fayalite, liquid-bearing stability fields appear below the gas-solid stability field in the Fe-rich portion of the system. The compositional range of liquid-bearing fields expand with increasing pressure; at 10-4 bar, the liquid-bearing fields cover most of the olivine system (XMg {\textless} 0.9). Liquid is absent at pressures below the triple point of fayalite, regardless of the composition. Large Mg Fe fractionation between gas and solid is more extensive, compared to the solid and liquid relationship. When heated in equilibrium, olivine melts before evaporation in the pressure range of 10-7-10-3 bar. In a solar nebula with total pressure of 10-3 bar, olivine melts when the nebula is enriched in dust by more than an order of magnitude over the solar nebular value and when the (Mg + Si + Fe) H ratio increased. The origin of type IA and II chondrules and matrix olivine in ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites can be explained in terms of the pressure of olivine gas. Type IA chondrules were formed in the gas-solid phase field where volatiles (FeO, Na2O, and others) were lost during heating events responsible for chondrule formation. The residual materials became enriched in refractory elements. Type II chondrules were formed in the temperature range of the liquid-solid phase field. Under these conditions, the original compositions were retained after heating of chondrule formation. Provided that type IA and II chondrules were formed at a similar temperature, type IA chondrules were formed at an olivine pressure one order of magnitude lower than that of type II chondrules. In this model, matrix olivine is a condensate from gas which formed by partial evaporation of chondritic material during type IA chondrule formation. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Voronoi grids have been successfully used to represent density structures of gas in astronomical hydrodynamics simulations. While some codes are explicitly built around using a Voronoi grid, others, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), use particle-based representations and can benefit from constructing a Voronoi grid for post-processing their output. So far, calculating the density of each Voronoi cell from SPH data has been done numerically, which is both slow and potentially inaccurate. This paper proposes an alternative analytic method, which is fast and accurate. We derive an expression for the integral of a cubic spline kernel over the volume of a Voronoi cell and link it to the density of the cell. Mass conservation is ensured rigorously by the procedure. The method can be applied more broadly to integrate a spherically symmetric polynomial function over the volume of a random polyhedron.},

We find that in the large-scale collision regime considered here (with impact velocities of 4 km/s), the effect of material strength is substantial for the post-impact distribution of the temperature and the impactor material, while the influence of the Equation of State is more subtle and present only at very high temperatures.},

abstract = {Collisions between large, similar-sized bodies are believed to shape the final characteristics and composition of terrestrial planets. Their inventories of volatiles such as water, are either delivered or at least significantly modified by such events. Besides the transition from accretion to erosion with increasing impact velocity, similar-sized collisions can also result in hit-and-run outcomes for sufficiently oblique impact angles and large enough projectile-to-target mass ratios. We study volatile transfer and loss focusing on hit-and-run encounters by means of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, including all main parameters: impact velocity, impact angle, mass ratio, and also the total colliding mass. We find a broad range of overall water losses, up to 75{\%} in the most energetic hit-and-run events, and confirm the much more severe consequences for the smaller body also for stripping of volatile layers. Transfer of water between projectile and target inventories is found to be mostly rather inefficient, and final water contents are dominated by pre-collision inventories reduced by impact losses, for similar pre-collision water mass fractions. Comparison with our numerical results shows that current collision outcome models are not accurate enough to reliably predict these composition changes in hit-and-run events. To also account for non-mechanical losses we estimate the amount of collisionally vaporized water over a broad range of masses, and find that these contributions are particularly important in collisions of {\~{}}Mars-sized bodies, with sufficiently high impact energies, but still relatively low gravity. Our results clearly indicate that the cumulative effect of several (hit-and-run) collisions can efficiently strip protoplanets of their volatile layers, especially the smaller body, as it might be common e.g. for Earth-mass planets in systems with Super-Earths.},

abstract = {Giant impacts have been suggested to explain various characteristics of terrestrial planets and their moons. However, so far in most models only the immediate effects of the collisions have been considered, while the long-term interior evolution of the impacted planets was not studied. Here we present a new approach, combining 3-D shock physics collision calculations with 3-D thermochemical interior evolution models. We apply the combined methods to a demonstration example of a giant impact on a Mars-sized body, using typical collisional parameters from previous studies. While the material parameters (equation of state, rheology model) used in the impact simulations can have some effect on the long-term evolution, we find that the impact angle is the most crucial parameter for the resulting spatial distribution of the newly formed crust. The results indicate that a dichotomous crustal pattern can form after a head-on collision, while this is not the case when considering a more likely grazing collision. Our results underline that end-to-end 3-D calculations of the entire process are required to study in the future the effects of large-scale impacts on the evolution of planetary interiors.},

abstract = {The Isua supracrustal belt (ISB) and the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt (NGB) are among the oldest suites of mafic volcanic rocks preserved on Earth and are the best candidates for representing its early crust. Despite the possible 500 Ma age difference between the belts, these mantle-derived rocks show compositional similarities, with features resembling rocks formed in subduction initiation environments. With the addition of new142Nd data for the Garbenschiefer unit of the ISB reported here, high precision142Nd data are now available for all the mafic lithologies from both belts. Mantle-derived rocks from both the ISB and NGB belts exhibit a range of142Nd/144Nd ratios. The datasets for the two belts, however, are significantly different, suggesting a different origin for their142Nd anomalies. Nearly all ISB samples have excesses in142Nd, including the newly analyzed Garbenschiefer boninitic amphibolites (mean of +12 ppm). Excesses in142Nd/144Nd compared to the Nd standard for all the ISB rocks range between +8 and +20 ppm, with a near Gaussian distribution around +12 ppm. This distribution could simply reflect the analytical error (±5 ppm) around a single142Nd/144Nd ratio indicating that the samples formed after the extinction of146Sm from a source with a nearly uniform142Nd/144Nd ratio. In contrast, the NGB shows a range of142Nd/144Nd ratios from +8 to −18 ppm relative to the modern Nd standard and displays a flat distribution of142Nd/144Nd ratios. The ISB samples show no significant correlation between their142Nd/144Nd and Sm/Nd ratios, consistent with their formation in the Eoarchean via melting of a Hadean depleted mantle. In contrast, all NGB samples display a142Nd/144Nd vs. Sm/Nd correlation, consistent with their crystallization in the Hadean. The mantle sources for both the ISB and NGB mantle-derived rocks have a similar142Nd/144Nd ratio at the possible age of formation of the NGB (∼4.3 Ga) suggesting the derivation of ISB and NGB rocks from a common early-formed depleted mantle source formed between 4.47 and 4.42 Ga with a147Sm/144Nd ratio ∼0.218. This mantle appears to have been an important source component involved in the formation of the primitive crust during most of the Hadean and Eoarchean eons.},

abstract = {This paper deals with Oort cloud formation while the Sun was in an embedded cluster and surrounded by its primordial nebula. This work is a continuation of Brasser et al. [Brasser, R., Duncan, M., Levison, H., 2006. Icarus 184, 59-82], building on the model presented therein, and adding the aerodynamic drag and gravitational potential of the primordial solar nebula. Results are presented of numerical simulations of comets subject to the gravitational influence of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, star cluster and primordial solar nebula; some of the simulations included the gravitational influence of Uranus and Neptune as well. The primordial solar nebula was approximated by the minimum-mass Hayashi model [Hayashi, C., Nakozawa, K., Nakagawa, Y., 1985. In: Black, D.C., Matthews, M.S. (Eds.). Protostars and Planets II. Univ. of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ] whose inner and outer radii have been truncated at various distances from the Sun. A comet size of 1.7 km was used for most of our simulations. In all of our simulations, the density of the primordial solar nebula decayed exponentially with an e-folding time of 2 Myr. It turns out that when the primordial solar nebula extends much beyond Saturn or Neptune, virtually no material will end up in the Oort cloud (OC) during this phase. Instead, the majority of the material will be on circular orbits inside of Jupiter if the inner edge of the disk is well inside Jupiter's orbit. If the disk's inner edge is beyond Jupiter's orbit, most comets end up on orbits in exterior mean-motion resonances with Saturn when Uranus and Neptune are not present. In those cases where the outer edge of the disk is close to Saturn or Neptune, the fraction of material that ends up in the subsequently formed OC is much less than that found in Brasser et al. [Brasser, R., Duncan, M., Levison, H., 2006. Icarus 184, 59-82] for the same cluster densities. This implies that for comets of roughly 2 km in size, the presence of the primordial solar nebula hinders OC formation. A byproduct of some of our simulations are endresults with a substantial fraction of the comets in the Uranus-Neptune scattered disk. A subsequent followup of this material is planned for the near future. In order to determine the effect of the size of the comets on OC formation efficiency, a set of runs with the same initial conditions but different cometary radii have been performed as well, from which it is determined that the threshold comet size to begin producing significant Oort clouds is roughly 20 km. This implies that the presence of the primordial solar nebula acts as a size-sorting mechanism, with large bodies unaffected by the gas drag and ending up in the OC while small bodies remain trapped in the planetary region, in the models studied. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Stresses acting on cold, thick and negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere are thought to be crucial to the initiation of subduction and the operation of plate tectonics, which characterizes the present-day geodynamics of the Earth. Because the Earth's interior was hotter in the Archaean eon, the oceanic crust may have been thicker, thereby making the oceanic lithosphere more buoyant than at present, and whether subduction and plate tectonics occurred during this time is ambiguous, both in the geological record and in geodynamic models. Here we show that because the oceanic crust was thick and buoyant, early continents may have produced intra-lithospheric gravitational stresses large enough to drive their gravitational spreading, to initiate subduction at their margins and to trigger episodes of subduction. Our model predicts the co-occurrence of deep to progressively shallower mafic volcanics and arc magmatism within continents in a self-consistent geodynamic framework, explaining the enigmatic multimodal volcanism and tectonic record of Archaean cratons. Moreover, our model predicts a petrological stratification and tectonic structure of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, two predictions that are consistent with xenolith and seismic studies, respectively, and consistent with the existence of a mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuity. The slow gravitational collapse of early continents could have kick-started transient episodes of plate tectonics until, as the Earth's interior cooled and oceanic lithosphere became heavier, plate tectonics became self-sustaining.},

abstract = {We numerically simulated the impacts of asteroids and comets on the Moon in order to calculate the amount of condensate that can be formed after the impacts and compare the results with data for lunar samples. Using available equations of state for quartz and dunite, we have determined pressure and density behind shock waves in these materials for particle velocities from 4 to 20. km/s and obtained release adiabats from various points on the Hugoniot curves to very low pressures. For shock waves with particle velocities behind the front below 8. km/s the release adiabats intersect the liquid branch of the two-phase curve and, during the following expansion, the liquid material vaporizes and does not condense, forming a two-phase mixture of melt and vapor. The condensate can appear during expansion of material compressed by a shock with higher ({\textgreater}8. km/s) velocities. Using our hydrocode SOVA, we have conducted numerical simulations of the impacts of spherical quartz, dunite, and water-ice projectiles into targets of the same materials. Impact velocities were 15-25. km/s for stony projectiles and 20-70. km/s for icy impactors, and impact angles were 45°and 90° to the target surface. Along with the masses of condensates we calculated the masses of vaporized and melted material. Upon the impact of a projectile consisting of dunite into a target of quartz at a speed of 20. km/s at an angle of 45°, vaporized and melted masses of the target are equal to 1.6 and 11 in units of projectile mass, respectively, and the mass of condensate is 0.19. Vaporized and condensed masses of the projectile are 0.16 and 0.02, more than 80{\%} of the projectile mass is melted. The calculated ratio of vaporized to melted mass proved to be on the order of 0.1. However, we calculated that, at impact velocities below 20. km/s, the condensate mass is only a small fraction of the vaporized and melted masses and, consequently, the major part of vapor disperses in vacuum in the form of separate molecules or molecular clusters. At an impact velocity of 15. km/s, the abundance of silicate condensates relative to melt is 0.001-0.0001, in agreement with data from lunar samples. Should the observed condensate abundances be representative, the velocities of major asteroid impacts on the Moon could not substantially exceed 20. km/s. Comet impacts at the same velocities produce much smaller amounts of vapor condensate because the low densities of cometary material induce lower shock pressures in the target.},

abstract = {We have measured Sm-Nd systematics, including the short-lived 146Sm-142Nd chronometer, in lunar ferroan anorthositic suite (FAS) whole rocks (15415, 62236, 62255, 65315, 60025). At least some members of the suite are thought to be primary crystallization products formed by plagioclase flotation during crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO). Most of these samples, except 62236, have not been exposed to galactic cosmic rays for a long period and thus require minimal correction to their 142Nd isotope composition. These samples all have measured deficits in 142Nd relative to the JNdi-1 terrestrial standard in the range -45 to -21ppm. The range is -45 to -15ppm once the 62236 142Nd/144Nd ratio is corrected from neutron-capture effects. Analyzed FAS samples do not define a single isochron in either 146Sm-142Nd or 147Sm-143Nd systematics, suggesting that they either do not have the same crystallization age, come from different sources, or have suffered isotopic disturbance. Because the age is not known for some samples, we explore the implications of their initial isotopic compositions for crystallization ages in the first 400Ma of solar system history, a timing interval that covers all the ages determined for the ferroan anorthositic suite whole rocks as well as different estimates for the crystallization of the LMO. 62255 has the largest deficit in initial 142Nd and does not appear to have followed the same differentiation path as the other FAS samples. The large deficit in 142Nd of FAN 62255 may suggest a crystallization age around 60-125Ma after the beginning of solar system accretion. This result provides essential information about the age of the giant impact forming the Moon. The initial Nd isotopic compositions of FAS samples can be matched either with a bulk-Moon with chondritic Sm/Nd ratio but enstatite-chondrite-like initial 142Nd/144Nd (e.g. 10ppm below modern terrestrial), or a bulk-Moon with superchondritic Sm/Nd ratio and initial 142Nd/144Nd similar to ordinary chondrites.},

Isochron ages determined in this study for 77215 are: Rb-Sr=4450±270 Ma, (147)Sm-(143)Nd=4283±23 Ma and Lu-Hf=4421±68 Ma. The data define an initial (146)Sm/(144)Sm ratio of 0.00193±0.00092 corresponding to ages between 4348 and 4413 Ma depending on the half-life and initial abundance used for (146)Sm. The initial Nd and Hf isotopic compositions of all samples indicate a source region with slight enrichment in the incompatible elements in accord with previous suggestions that the Mg-suite crustal rocks contain a component of KREEP. The Sm/Nd-(142)Nd/(144)Nd correlation shown by both ferroan anorthosite and Mg-suite rocks is coincident with the trend defined by mare and KREEP basalts, the slope of which corresponds to ages between 4.35 and 4.45 Ga. These data, along with similar ages for various early Earth differentiation events, are in accord with the model of lunar formation via giant impact into Earth at ca 4.4 Ga.},

The abundance of the moderately volatile element K, relative to Th and U, is inconsistent with physical models for the formation of Mercury requiring extreme heating of the planet or its precursor materials, and supports formation from volatile-containing material comparable to chondritic meteorites.

On the basis of the obtained density data the molar volume, partial molar volume, and ex- cess molar volume of the melts were calculated in order to consider the possible chemical interactions of components. In the system KF—K2MoO4 the density increases monotonically with increasing content of K2MoO4. The formation of the additive compound K3FMoO4 causes only small positive devia- tions from the ideal behaviour. In the system KF—SiO2 the density increases with increasing content of SiO2. The partial molar volume of SiO2 in the melt is a little higher than that of the pure SiO2, which may refer to some weak chemical interaction of both components leading to a small volume expansion. The density of the system K2MoO4—SiO2 increases with increasing content of SiO2. The partial molar volume of SiO2 in the infinitely diluted solution, V SiO2 =3.65 cm3 mol−1,may refertoa strong chemical interaction of both components accompanied by a substantial volume contraction. Two different regions are present in the investigated part of the system KF—K2MoO4—SiO2. In the region of low content of SiO2, near the figurative point of K3FMoO4, there is a region of volume expansion, while at higher SiO2 concentration a region of volume contraction is present. The volume expansion is caused by the formation of the additive compound K3FMoO4, while the volume contraction refers probably to the formation of the heteropolyanions [SiMo12O40]4−.},

abstract = {The distributions of major and minor elements in Earth's core and mantle were primarily established by high pressure, high temperature metal–silicate partitioning during core segregation. The partitioning behaviors of moderately siderophile elements can be used to constrain the pressure–temperature conditions of core formation and the core's composition. We performed experiments to study the partitioning of Ni, Co, V, Cr, Si, and O between silicate melt and Fe-rich metallic melt in a multianvil press and diamond anvil cell, up to 100GPa and 5700K. Combining our new results with data from 18 previous studies, we parameterized the effects of pressure, temperature, and metallic melt composition on partitioning. Ni and Co partitioning are insensitive to composition. At low pressures, these elements become less siderophile with increasing temperature, with this trend reversing above ∼45GPa. V and Cr partitioning are much more sensitive to metallic melt composition and less sensitive to pressure. Partitioning of Si and O are insensitive to pressure, but with strong and moderate temperature dependences, respectively. Our new parameterizations of Ni and Co partitioning suggest that the Earth's distributions of these elements can be matched by single-stage core–mantle equilibration at 54±5GPa and 3300–3400K. These conditions would result in 8.5±1.4wt{\%} Si and 1.6±0.3wt{\%} O in the core, compatible with the core's measured density. However, this single-stage model matches the Earth's V and Cr distributions less well. We also incorporated our parameterizations into models of multi-stage core formation over evolving pressure–temperature-oxygen fugacity conditions, reproducing the Earth's Ni and Co distributions while simultaneously producing a core whose light element composition is consistent with its density.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2-4{\%}, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the interior structure of Mars is of fundamental importance to the understanding of its past and present state as well as its future evolution. The most prominent interior structure properties are the state of the core, solid or liquid, its radius, and its composition in terms of light elements, the thickness of the mantle, its composition, the presence of a lower mantle, and the density of the crust. In the absence of seismic sounding only geodesy data allow reliably constraining the deep interior of Mars. Those data are the mass, moment of inertia, and tides. They are related to Mars' composition, to its internal mass distribution, and to its deformational response to principally the tidal forcing of the Sun. Here we use the most recent estimates of the moment of inertia and tidal Love number k2 in order to infer knowledge about the interior structure of the Mars. We have built precise models of the interior structure of Mars that are parameterized by the crust density and thickness, the volume fractions of upper mantle mineral phases, the bulk mantle iron concentration, and the size and the sulfur concentration of the core. From the bulk mantle iron concentration and from the volume fractions of the upper mantle mineral phases, the depth dependent mineralogy is deduced by using experimentally determined phase diagrams. The thermoelastic properties at each depth inside the mantle are calculated by using equations of state. Since it is difficult to determine the temperature inside the mantle of Mars we here use two end-member temperature profiles that have been deduced from studies dedicated to the thermal evolution of Mars. We calculate the pressure and temperature dependent thermoelastic properties of the core constituents by using equations state and recent data about reference thermoelastic properties of liquid iron, liquid iron-sulfur, and solid iron. To determine the size of a possible inner core we use recent data on the melting temperature of iron-sulfur. Within our model assumptions the geodesy data imply that Mars has no solid inner core and that the liquid core contains a large fraction of sulfur. The absence of a solid inner is in agreement with the absence of a global magnetic field. We estimate the radius of the core to be 1794 ?? 65. km and its core sulfur concentration to be 16 ?? 2. wt{\%}. We also show that it is possible for Mars to have a thin layer of perovskite at the bottom of the mantle if it has a hot mantle temperature. Moreover a chondritic Fe/Si ratio is shown to be consistent with the geodesy data, although significantly different value are also possible. Our results demonstrate that geodesy data alone, even if a mantle temperature is assumed, can almost not constrain the mineralogy of the mantle and the crust. In order to obtain stronger constraints on the mantle mineralogy bulk properties, like a fixed Fe/Si ratio, have to be assumed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The surface of Mars consists of an old, heavily cratered and elevated southern hemisphere and younger, resurfaced and depressed northern hemisphere, a feature often termed the crustal dichotomy. The global crustal structure [Zuber et al., 2000] revealed by topography and gravity data from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, and the possible late formation of the boundary zone between the hemispheres [McGill and Dimitriou, 1990], have been proposed to indicate an endogenic origin for the dichotomy. However, degree-1 mantle convection that is required for any endogenic process to be viable cannot be produced with conventional mantle convection models [Schubert et al., 1990]. We have studied the role of radially stratified viscosity on mantle deformation by using Rayleigh-Taylor instability analyses in a spherical shell geometry. Our analyses reveal that when mantle viscosity is stratified with a weak asthenosphere, deformation at long wavelengths is more efficient than that at short wavelengths. The weaker the asthenosphere, the longer the wavelength at which the deformation is the most efficient. A thicker asthenosphere also favors the deformation at long wavelengths. Both the Rayleigh-Taylor instability analyses and numerical modeling of mantle convection show that degree-1 convection can be produced within the Martian mantle provided that the mantle had a weak asthenosphere (∼ 500 km thick and ∼ 102 times weaker than the underlying mantle) early in planetary history. The degree-1 convection causes preferential heating of one hemisphere that may explain the primary features associated with the dichotomy in crustal structure. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Rubie2015a,
abstract = {In order to test accretion simulations as well as planetary differentiation scenarios, we have integrated a multistage core–mantle differentiation model with N-body accretion simulations. Impacts between embryos and planetesimals are considered to result in magma ocean formation and episodes of core formation. The core formation model combines rigorous chemical mass balance with metal–silicate element partitioning data and requires that the bulk compositions of all starting embryos and planetesimals are defined as a function of their heliocentric distances of origin. To do this, we assume that non-volatile elements are present in Solar System (CI) relative abundances in all bodies and that oxygen and H2O contents are the main compositional variables. The primary constraint on the combined model is the composition of the Earth's primitive mantle. In addition, we aim to reproduce the composition of the martian mantle and the mass fractions of the metallic cores of Earth and Mars. The model is refined by least squares minimization with up to five fitting parameters that consist of the metal–silicate equilibration pressure and 1–4 parameters that define the starting compositions of primitive bodies. This integrated model has been applied to six Grand Tack N-body accretion simulations. Investigations of a broad parameter space indicate that: (1) accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, (2) metal–silicate equilibration pressures increase as accretion progresses and are, on average, 60–70{\%} of core–mantle boundary pressures at the time of each impact, and (3) a large fraction (70–100{\%}) of the metal of impactor cores equilibrates with a small fraction of the silicate mantles of proto-planets during each core formation event. Results are highly sensitive to the compositional model for the primitive starting bodies and several accretion/core-formation models can thus be excluded. Acceptable fits to the Earth's mantle composition are obtained only when bodies that originated close to the Sun, at {\textless}0.9–1.2AU, are highly reduced and those from beyond this distance are increasingly oxidized. Reasonable concentrations of H2O in Earth's mantle are obtained when bodies originating from beyond 6–7AU contain 20wt{\%} water ice (icy bodies that originated between the snow line and this distance did not contribute to Earth's accretion because they were swept up by Jupiter and Saturn). In the six models examined, water is added to the Earth mainly after 60–80{\%} of its final mass has accreted. The compositional evolution of the mantles of Venus and Mars are also constrained by the model. The FeO content of the martian mantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which the Mars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth's core is predicted to contain 8–9wt{\%} silicon, 2–4wt{\%} oxygen and 10–60ppm hydrogen, whereas the martian core is predicted to contain low concentrations ({\textless}1wt{\%}) of Si and O.},

abstract = {The progressive drying-out of Mars' surface was punctuated by a dramatic transient increase in fluvial erosion around the Noachian-Hesperian boundary ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}3.7 Ga). Standard explanations of this climate optimum appeal to volcano- or impact-triggered climates and imply that individual runoff episodes were brief, apparently inconsistent with evidence for persistent runoff. We examine a scenario in which the duration, intensity and uniqueness of the Noachian-Hesperian climate optimum result from degassing of CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}-clathrate consequent to atmospheric collapse. Atmospheric collapse causes low-latitude surface water ice to sublimate away, depressurizing and thus destabilizing CH{\$}{\_}4{\$} clathrate in subglacial pore space. Subsequent atmospheric re-inflation leads to warming that further destabilizes CH{\$}{\_}4{\$} clathrate. CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}-induced warming is efficient, permitting strong positive feedbacks, and possibly raising Mars into a climate optimum. The optimum is brought to a close by photochemical destruction of CH{\$}{\_}4{\$} or by a new atmospheric collapse, and drawdown of the CH{\$}{\_}4{\$}-clathrate reservoir prevents recurrence. This scenario predicts a 10{\$}{\^{}}5{\$}-10{\$}{\^{}}6{\$} yr climate optimum, transient connections between the deep hydrosphere and the surface, mud volcanism, and strong surface weathering, all of which are consistent with recent observations. Crustal hydrothermal circulation very early in Mars history could yield CH{\$}{\_}4{\$} that would be incorporated into clathrate on approach to the cold surface. The scenario explains why regional watershed integration on Mars occurred relatively late and apparently only once, and suggests that the contrasts between Noachian versus Hesperian climate-sensitive deposits on Mars correspond to a transition from a never-collapsed atmosphere to a collapse-prone climate, ultimately driven by slow loss of CO{\$}{\_}2{\$} to space.},

abstract = {One of the most directly observable features of a transiting multi-planet system is their size-ordering when ranked in orbital separation. Kepler has revealed a rich diversity of outcomes, from perfectly ordered systems, like Kepler-80, to ostensibly disordered systems, like Kepler-20. Under the hypothesis that systems are born via preferred formation pathways, one might reasonably expect non-random size-orderings reflecting these processes. However, subsequent dynamical evolution, often chaotic and turbulent in nature, may erode this information and so here we ask - do systems remember how they formed? To address this, we devise a model to define the entropy of a planetary system's size-ordering, by first comparing differences between neighboring planets and then extending to accommodate differences across the chain. We derive closed-form solutions for many of the micro state occupancies and provide public code with look-up tables to compute entropy for up to ten-planet systems. All three proposed entropy definitions exhibit the expected property that their credible interval increases with respect to a proxy for time. We find that the observed Kepler multis display a highly significant deficit in entropy compared to a randomly generated population. Incorporating a filter for systems deemed likely to be dynamically packed, we show that this result is robust against the possibility of missing planets too. Put together, our work establishes that Kepler systems do indeed remember something of their younger years and highlights the value of information theory for exoplanetary science.},

For the statistically most-likely oblique collision (about 45degree), the impactor's core elongates and thereafter disintegrates into a metallic hail of small particles (about 10 m). Some strike the orbiting Moon as sesquinary impactors, but most re-accrete to Earth as secondaries with further fragmentation.

abstract = {We construct a "hyperparameter matrix" statistical method for performing the joint analyses of multiple correlated astronomical data sets, in which the weights of data sets are determined by their own statistical properties. This method is a generalization of the hyperparameter method constructed by Lahav etal. (2000) and Hobson etal. (2002) which was designed to combine independent data sets. The advantage of our method is to treat correlations between multiple data sets and gives appropriate relevant weights of multiple data sets with mutual correlations. We define a new "element-wise" product, which greatly simplifies the likelihood function with hyperparameter matrix. We rigorously prove the simplified formula of the joint likelihood and show that it recovers the original hyperparameter method in the limit of no covariance between data sets. We then illustrate the method by applying it to a demonstrative toy model of fitting a straight line to two sets of data. We show that the hyperparameter matrix method can detect unaccounted systematic errors or underestimated errors in the data sets. Additionally, the ratio of Bayes' factors provides a distinct indicator of the necessity of including hyperparameters. Our example shows that the likelihood we construct for joint analyses of correlated data sets can be widely applied to many astrophysical systems. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many exoplanets have now been detected in orbits with ultra-short periods very close to the Roche limit. Building upon our previous work, we study the possibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the evolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a lower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in which the mass loss occurs slowly (“stable mass transfer” in the language of binary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation, and photo-evaporation (PE) of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic braking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche limit, in orbit around a Sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of RLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system can indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The RLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer and on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days for several Gyr. The remnant planets have rocky cores and some amount of envelope material, which is slowly removed via PE at a nearly constant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. For these remnant planets, we also predict an anti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets ( M pl ≲ 5 M ⊕ ) in ultra-short periods ( P orb {\textless} 1 day) cannot be produced through this type of evolution.},

abstract = {The empirical linear relation between the volume and logarithm of bulk modulus of metals, discovered by Grover, Getting, and Kennedy is taken as the basis for our equation of state. Recently, we have shown that we can use this equation of state to make accurate predictions of thermochemical and thermophysical properties at high pressure and high temperatures for MgO and the polymorphs of Mg2SiO4. Using the available experimental information, the equation of state is applied to the two polymorphs and the liquid form of Fe2SiO4 to develop a consistent dataset of their thermodynamic properties in the temperature range between 150 and 2500 K and pressure range between 1 bar 13 GPa. Using thermodynamic methods we are able to discriminate experimental data from different sources. The results presented here are compared with results obtained with modern databases. For (Mg1 - xFex)2SiO4 solid solutions around a pyrolitic composition, we conclude that bulk sound velocity is not a strong discriminator in selecting Gibbs energy formulations for Fe2SiO4 using one database versus another. This is in contrast to what found for Mg2SiO4. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

We use results from first-principles molecular dynamics of nine compositions along the MgO-SiO2 binary to investigate the compositional dependence of liquid state thermodynamics, applying our results to describe incongruent melting for the system at deep lower mantle pressures. Our phase diagram is bi-eutectic throughout the lower mantle, with no liquid immiscibility. Accounting for solid-liquid partitioning of Fe, we find partial melts of basaltic and peridotitic lithologies to be gravitationally stable at the core-mantle boundary, while liquidus density contrasts predict that perovskite will sink and periclase will float in a crystallizing pyrolytic magma ocean. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We perform first principles molecular dynamics simulations of Mg2SiO4 liquid and crystalline forsterite. On compression by a factor of two, we find that the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter of the liquid increases linearly from 0.6 to 1.2. Comparison of liquid and forsterite equations of state reveals a temperature-dependent density crossover at pressures of ∼12-17 GPa. Along the melting curve, which we calculate by integration of the Clapeyron equation, the density crossover occurs within the forsterite stability field at P = 13 GPa and T = 2550 K. The melting curve obtained from the root mean-square atomic displacement in forsterite using the Lindemann law fails to match experimental or calculated melting curves. We attribute this failure to the liquid structure that differs significantly from that of forsterite, and which changes markedly upon compression, with increases in the degree of polymerization and coordination. The mean Si coordination increases from 4 in the uncompressed system to 6 upon twofold compression. The self-diffusion coefficients increase with temperature and decrease monotonically with pressure, and are well described by the Arrhenian relation. We compare our equation of state to the available highpressure shock wave data for forsterite and wadsleyite. Our theoretical liquid Hugoniot is consistent with partial melting along the forsterite Hugoniot at pressures 150-170 GPa, and complete melting at 170 GPa. The wadsleyite Hugoniot is likely sub-liquidus at the highest experimental pressure to date (200 GPa). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The discovery of deficits in 142Nd/144Nd in mafic rocks of the Nuvvuagittuq supracrustal belt (NSB) has triggered a debate about the possible preservation of Hadean (pre-3.85 Ga) crustal remnants in the little-known but areally extensive Innuksuac complex (3.6–3.8 Ga, Inukjuak domain, Northeast Superior Province, Canada). Geochronological investigations in the NSB, however, are hampered by the poor preservation and highly disturbed isotopic record of various mafic (amphibolite) lithologies that host the 142Nd anomalies. Here we present 146Sm–142Nd and 147Sm–143Nd data for rocks of extrusive magmatic and sedimentary protoliths from the Ukaliq supracrustal belt, a newly discovered volcano-sedimentary enclave enclosed in granitoid gneisses of the Inukjuak domain. Our study also includes the first 146Sm–142Nd data for quartz-magnetite rocks (banded iron-formation; BIF) of the NSB and the Eoarchean Isua supracrustal belt (ISB) in southern West Greenland. We show that Ukaliq amphibolites carry variably negative 142Nd anomalies, ranging from 0 to −10 ppm, which are positively correlated with their Sm/Nd ratio. If considered as an isochron relationship, the 146Sm–142Nd array yields an apparent Hadean emplacement age of 4215−76+50 Ma. The negative 142Nd anomalies, however, appear to be mainly restricted to amphibolites with boninitic affinities, likely reflecting inheritance from an enriched mantle source. In contrast, tholeiitic and ultramafic lavas have normal $\mu$142Nd regardless of their Sm/Nd ratio. Furthermore, BIF from Ukaliq and Nuvvuagittuq lack the negative 142Nd anomalies that should have been produced by in situ decay of 146Sm had these sediments been deposited prior to ca. 4.1 Ga. Instead, they exhibit $\mu$142Nd identical to that measured in Isua BIF. Collectively, our results suggest that the 146Sm–142Nd array characterizing mafic lithologies of Ukaliq and Nuvvuagittuq is an inherited signature with doubtful chronological significance. We interpret the volcanic protoliths of the Innuksuac complex to have been produced by metasomatically triggered melting of a variably enriched Eoarchean mantle, following addition of felsic melts and/or fluids derived from a foundering Hadean mafic crust. Application of coupled 146,147Sm–142,143Nd chronometry to Ukaliq lavas yields a model age of differentiation of 4.36−0.06+0.05 Ga for this Hadean precursor. This is similar to late-stage crystallization ages inferred for the lunar and terrestrial magma oceans. The long-term preservation of Earth's primordial crust points to subdued lithospheric recycling in the post-magma ocean Earth.},

This crust evolved from a highly mafic bulk composition before 3.0 billion years ago to a felsic bulk composition by 2.5 billion years ago.

abstract = {Moderately volatile elements (MVE) are key tracers of volatile depletion in planetary bodies. Zinc is an especially useful MVE because of its generally elevated abundances in planetary basalts, relative to other MVE, and limited evidence for mass-dependent isotopic fractionation under high-temperature igneous processes. Compared with terrestrial basalts, which have $\delta$66Zn values (per mille deviation of the 66Zn/64Zn ratio from the JMC-Lyon standard) similar to some chondrite meteorites (∼+0.3‰), lunar mare basalts yield a mean $\delta$66Zn value of +1.4 ± 0.5‰ (2 st. dev.). Furthermore, mare basalts have average Zn concentrations ∼50 times lower than in typical terrestrial basaltic rocks. Late-stage lunar magmatic products, including ferroan anorthosite, Mg- and Alkali-suite rocks have even higher $\delta$66Zn values (+3 to +6‰). Differences in Zn abundance and isotopic compositions between lunar and terrestrial rocks have previously been interpreted to reflect evaporative loss of Zn, either during the Earth-Moon formatting Giant Impact, or in a lunar magma ocean (LMO) phase. To explore the mechanisms and processes under which volatile element loss may have occurred during a LMO phase, we developed models of Zn isotopic fractionation that are generally applicable to planetary magma oceans. Our objective was to identify conditions that would yield a $\delta$66Zn signature of ∼ +1.4‰ within the lunar mantle. For the sake of simplicity, we neglect possible Zn isotopic fractionation during the Giant Impact, and assumed a starting composition equal to the composition of the present-day terrestrial mantle, assuming both the Earth and Moon had zinc ‘consanguinity' following their formation. We developed two models: the first simulates evaporative fractionation of Zn only prior to LMO mixing and crystallization; the second simulates continued evaporative fractionation of Zn that persists until ∼75{\%} LMO crystallization. The first model yields a relatively homogenous bulk solid LMO $\delta$66Zn value, while the second results in a stratification of $\delta$66Zn values within the LMO sequence. Loss and/or isolation mechanisms for volatiles are critical to these models; hydrodynamic escape was not a dominant process, but loss of a nascent lunar atmosphere or separation of condensates into a proto-lunar crust are possible mechanisms by which volatiles could be separated from the lunar interior. The results do not preclude models that suggest a lunar volatile depletion episode related to Giant Impact. Conversely, LMO models for volatile loss do not require loss of volatiles prior to lunar formation. Outgassing during planetary magma ocean phases likely played a profound part in setting the volatile inventories of planets, particularly for low mass bodies that experienced the greatest volatile loss. In turn, our result suggest that the initial compositions of planets that accreted from smaller, highly differentiated planetesimals were likely to be severely volatile depleted.},

abstract = {The asteroid belt contains less than a thousandth of Earth's mass and is radially segregated, with S-types dominating the inner belt and C-types the outer belt. It is generally assumed that the belt formed with far more mass and was later strongly depleted. Here we show that the present-day asteroid belt is consistent with having formed empty, without any planetesimals between Mars and Jupiter's present-day orbits. This is consistent with models in which drifting dust is concentrated into an isolated annulus of terrestrial planetesimals. Gravitational scattering during terrestrial planet formation causes radial spreading, transporting planetesimals from inside 1-1.5 AU out to the belt. Several times the total current mass in S-types is implanted, with a preference for the inner main belt. C-types are implanted from the outside, as the giant planets' gas accretion destabilizes nearby planetesimals and injects a fraction into the asteroid belt, preferentially in the outer main belt. These implantation mechanisms are simple byproducts of terrestrial- and giant planet formation. The asteroid belt may thus represent a repository for planetary leftovers that accreted across the Solar System but not in the belt itself.},

@article{Bekaert2017,
abstract = {Despite extensive effort during the last four decades, no clear signature of a lunar indigenous noble gas component has been found. In order to further investigate the possible occurrence of indigenous volatiles in the Moon, we have re-analyzed the noble gas and nitrogen isotopic compositions in three anorthosite samples. Lunar anorthosites 60025, 60215 and 65315 have the lowest exposure duration (∼2Ma) among Apollo samples and consequently contain only limited cosmogenic (e.g. 124,126Xe) and solar wind (SW) noble gases. Furthermore, anorthosites have negligible contributions of fissiogenic Xe isotopes because of their very low Pu and U contents. As observed in previous studies (Lightner and Marti, 1974; Leich and Niemeyer, 1975), lunar anorthosite Xe presents an isotopic composition very close to that of terrestrial atmospheric Xe, previously attributed to “anomalous adsorption” of terrestrial Xe after sample return. The presumed atmospheric Xe contamination can only be removed by heating the samples at medium to high temperatures under vacuum, and is therefore different from common adsorption. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the adsorption of Xe onto lunar anorthositic powder using infrared reflectance spectroscopy. A clear shift in the anorthosite IR absorbance peaks is detected when comparing the IR absorbance spectra of the lunar anorthositic powder before and after exposure to a neutral Xe-rich atmosphere. This observation accounts for the chemical bonding (chemisorption) of Xe onto anorthosite, which is stronger than the common physical bonding (physisorption) and could account for the anomalous adsorption of Xe onto lunar samples. Our high precision Xe isotope analyses show slight mass fractionation patterns across 128-136Xe isotopes with systematic deficits in the heavy Xe isotopes (mostly 136Xe and marginally 134Xe) that have not previously been observed. This composition could be the result of mixing between an irreversibly adsorbed terrestrial contaminant that is mostly released at high temperature and an additional signature. Solar Wind (SW) Xe contents, estimated from SW-Ne and SW-Ar concentrations and SW-Ne/Ar/Xe elemental ratios, do not support SW as the additional contribution. Using a $\chi$2 test, the latter is best accounted for by cometary Xe as measured in the coma of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (Marty et al., 2017) or by the primordial U-Xe composition inferred to be the precursor of atmospheric Xe (Pepin, 1994; Avice et al., 2017). It could have been contributed to the lunar budget by volatile-rich bodies that participated to the building of the terrestrial atmosphere inventory (Marty et al., 2017).},

abstract = {Heavily cratered surfaces on the Moon, Mars, and Mercury show that the terrestrial planets were battered by an intense bombardment during their first billion years or more, but the timing, sources, and dynamical implications of these impacts are controversial. The Late Heavy Bombardment refers to impact events that occurred after stabilization of the planetary lithospheres such that they could be preserved as craters and basins. Lunar melt rocks and meteorite shock ages point toward a discrete episode of elevated impact flux between ∼3.5 and ∼4.0–4.2 Ga, and a relative quiescence between ∼4.0–4.2 and ∼4.4 Ga. Evidence from Precambrian impact spherule layers suggests that a long-lived tail of terrestrial impactors lasted to ∼2.0–2.5 Ga. Dynamical models that include populations residual from primary accretion and destabilized by giant planet migration can potentially account for the available observations, although all have pros and cons. The most parsimonious solution to match constraints is a hybrid mode...},

The siderophile behavior of W, combined with the lithophile nature of Hf, makes the system uniquely useful as a chronometer of planetary accretion and differentiation. Tungsten isotopic data for meteorites show that the parent bodies of some differentiated meteorites accreted within 1 million years after Solar System formation. Melting and differentiation on these bodies took ∼1–3 million years and was fueled by decay of 26Al. The timescale for accretion and core formation increases with planetary mass and is ∼10 million years for Mars and {\textgreater}34 million years for Earth. The nearly identical 182W compositions for the mantles of the Moon and Earth are difficult to explain in current models for the formation of the Moon.

This review covers all aspects of planet formation by pebble accretion, from dust growth over planetesimal formation to the accretion of protoplanets and fully grown planets with gaseous envelopes. Pebbles are accreted at a very high rate—orders of magnitude higher than planetesimal accretion—and the rate decreases only slowly with distance from the central star. This allows planetary cores to start their growth in much more distant positions than their final orbits. The giant planets orbiting our Sun and other stars, including systems of wide-orbit exoplanets, can therefore be formed in complete consistency with planetary migration. We demonstrate how growth tracks of planetary mass versus semimajor axis can be obtained for all the major classes of planets by integrating a relatively simple set of governing equations.},

abstract = {The record of the continental lithosphere is patchy and incomplete; no known rock is older than 4.02 Ga, and less than 5{\%} of the rocks preserved are older than 3 Ga. In addition, there is no recognizable mantle lithosphere from before 3 Ga. We infer that there was lithosphere before 3 Ga and that ∼3 Ga marks the stabilization of blocks of continental lithosphere that have since survived. This was linked to plate tectonics emerging as the dominant tectonic regime in response to thermal cooling, the development of a more rigid lithosphere, and the recycling of water, which may in turn have facilitated plate tectonics. A number of models, using different approaches, suggest that at 3 Ga the volume of continental crust was ∼70{\%} of its present-day volume and that this may be a minimum value. The continental crust before 3 Ga was on average more mafic than that generated subsequently, and this pre-3 Ga mafic new crust had fractionated Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd ratios as inferred for the sources of tonalite-trondhjemite-g...},

abstract = {The past 10 years have seen major advances in our understanding of how Earth first developed. With better measurements of circumstellar disk life times and new theories for the Moon-forming giant impact, driven by improvements in theory and modeling that are tensioned against new kinds of isotopic and other geochemical constraints, the origins of Earth-like planets have never been clearer. This is particularly interesting and relevant to the current search for exosolar habitable environments. Isotope geochemistry provides powerful evidence that Earth formed over a protracted period of more than 30Ma, culminating in the giant impact. Oxygen and titanium isotopes provide evidence that most of the atoms in the Moon were derived from Earth requiring revisions to giant impact simulations. The core started forming early and we now have clear isotopic evidence that silicon is one of the light constituents. The origins of Earth's volatiles are still debated, but there is increasing evidence for the importance of chondrites and comets as opposed to solar volatiles. The timing and importance of any late veneer are still debated, while new isotopic data provide unequivocal evidence of early mantle heterogeneity, much of which has been eliminated with billions of years of mantle convective mixing.},

abstract = {Phosphorus is a key biologic element, and a prebiotic pathway leading to its incorporation into biomolecules has been difficult to ascertain. Most potentially prebiotic phosphorylation reactions have relied on orthophosphate as the source of phosphorus. It is suggested here that the geochemistry of phosphorus on the early Earth was instead controlled by reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds such as phosphite (HPO(3)(2-)), which are more soluble and reactive than orthophosphates. This reduced oxidation state phosphorus originated from extraterrestrial material that fell during the heavy bombardment period or was produced during impacts, and persisted in the mildly reducing atmosphere. This alternate view of early Earth phosphorus geochemistry provides an unexplored route to the formation of pertinent prebiotic phosphorus compounds, suggests a facile reaction pathway to condensed phosphates, and is consistent with the biochemical usage of reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds in life today. Possible studies are suggested that may detect reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds in ancient Archean rocks.},

abstract = {The heat transport and lithospheric dynamics of early Earth are currently explained by plate tectonic and vertical tectonic models, but these do not offer a global synthesis consistent with the geologic record. Here we use numerical simulations and comparison with the geologic record to explore a heat-pipe model in which volcanism dominates surface heat transport. These simulations indicate that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.},

The first crust was mafic and it internally melted repeatedly to produce the felsic rocks that crystallized the Jack Hills zircons. This crust was destabilized during late heavy bombardment. Plate tectonics probably started soon after and had produced voluminous continental crust by the mid Archean, but ocean volumes were sufficient to submerge much of this crust. In the Hadean and early Archean, hydrothermal systems around abundant komatiitic volcanism may have provided suitable sites to host the earliest living communities and for the evolution of key enzymes.

abstract = {The first approximately 600 million years of Earth history (the 'Hadean' eon) remain poorly understood, largely because there is no rock record dating from that era. Detrital Hadean igneous zircons from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, however, can potentially provide insights into the conditions extant on our planet at that time. Results of geochemical investigations using these ancient grains have been interpreted to suggest the presence of a hydrosphere and continental crust before 4 Gyr. An underexploited characteristic of the {\textgreater}4 Gyr zircons is their diverse assemblage of mineral inclusions. Here we present an examination of over 400 Hadean zircons from Jack Hills, which shows that some inclusion assemblages are conducive to thermobarometry. Our thermobarometric analyses of 4.02-4.19-Gyr-old inclusion-bearing zircons constrain their magmatic formation conditions to about 700 degrees C and 7 kbar. This result implies a near-surface heat flow of approximately 75 mW m(-2), about three to five times lower than estimates of Hadean global heat flow. As the only site of magmatism on modern Earth that is characterized by heat flow of about one-quarter of the global average is above subduction zones, we suggest that the magmas from which the Jack Hills Hadean zircons crystallized were formed largely in an underthrust environment, perhaps similar to modern convergent margins.},

abstract = {Estimates of carbon concentrations in Earth[rsquor]s mantle vary over more than an order of magnitude, hindering our ability to understand mantle structure and mineralogy, partial melting, and the carbon cycle. CO2 concentrations in mantle-derived magmas supplying hotspot ocean island volcanoes yield our most direct constraints on mantle carbon, but are extensively modified by degassing during ascent. Here we show that undegassed magmatic and mantle carbon concentrations may be estimated in a Bayesian framework using diverse geologic information at an ocean island volcano. Our CO2 concentration estimates do not rely upon complex degassing models, geochemical tracer elements, assumed magma supply rates, or rare undegassed rock samples. Rather, we couple volcanic CO2 emission rates with probabilistic magma supply rates, which are obtained indirectly from magma storage and eruption rates. We estimate that the CO2 content of mantle-derived magma supplying Hawai/`i[rsquor]s active volcanoes is 0.97-0.19+0.25 wt{\%}[mdash]roughly 40{\%} higher than previously believed[mdash]and is supplied from a mantle source region with a carbon concentration of 263-62+81[thinsp]ppm. Our results suggest that mantle plumes and ocean island basalts are carbon-rich. Our data also shed light on helium isotope abundances, CO2/Nb ratios, and may imply higher CO2 emission rates from ocean island volcanoes.},

abstract = {In the presence of a magnetic field and weakly ionizing winds, ohmic dissipation is expected to take place in the envelopes of Jovian and lower-mass planets alike. While the process has been investigated on the former, there have been no studies done on mini-Neptunes so far. From structure and thermal evolution models, we determine that the required energy deposition for halting the contraction of mini-Neptunes increases with planetary mass and envelope fraction. Scaled to the insolation power, the ohmic heating needed is small {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} -- orders of magnitude lower than for exo-Jupiters {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}. Conversely, from solving the magnetic induction equation, we find that ohmic energy is dissipated more readily for lower-mass planets and those with larger envelope fractions. Combining these two trends, we find that ohmic dissipation in hot mini-Neptunes is strong enough to inflate their radii ({\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$} W for {\$}T{\_}{\{}eq{\}}=1400K{\$}). The implication is that the radii of hot mini-Neptunes may be attributed in part to ohmic heating. Thus, there is a trade-off between ohmic dissipation and H/He content for hot mini-Neptunes, adding a new degeneracy for the interpretation of the composition of such planets. In addition, ohmic dissipation would make mini-Neptunes more vulnerable to atmospheric evaporation.},

abstract = {Planet-planet collisions are a common outcome of instability in systems of transiting planets close to the star, as well as occurring during in-situ formation of such planets from embryos. Previous N-body studies of instability amongst transiting planets have assumed that collisions result in perfect merging. Here, we explore the effects of implementing a more realistic collision prescription on the outcomes of instability and in-situ formation at orbital radii of a few tenths of an au. There is a strong effect on the outcome of the growth of planetary embryos, so long as the debris thrown off in collisions is rapidly removed from the system (by collisional processing to dust, and then removal by radiation forces). If this is the case, then systems form fewer detectable planets than systems evolved under the assumption of perfect merging in collisions. This provides some contribution to the "Kepler Dichotomy": the observed over-abundance of single-planet systems. The effects of changing the collision prescription on unstable mature systems of super-Earths are less pronounced. Perfect mergers only account for a minority of collision outcomes in such systems, but most collisions resulting in mass loss are grazing impacts in which only a few per cent. of mass is lost. As a result, there is little impact on the final masses and multiplicities of the systems after instability when compared to systems evolved under the assumption that collisions always result in perfect merging.},

abstract = {The rock record and geochemical evidence indicate that continental recycling has been occurring since the early history of the Earth. The stabilization of felsic continents in place of Earth/'s early mafic crust about 3.0 to 2.0 billion years ago, perhaps due to the initiation of plate tectonics, implies widespread destruction of mafic crust during this time interval. However, the physical mechanisms of such intense recycling on a hotter, (late) Archaean and presumably plate-tectonic Earth remain largely unknown. Here we use thermomechanical modelling to show that extensive recycling via lower crustal peeling-off (delamination but not eclogitic dripping) during continent-continent convergence was near ubiquitous during the late Archaean to early Proterozoic. We propose that such destruction of the early mafic crust, together with felsic magmatism, may have caused both the emergence of silicic continents and their subsequent isostatic rise, possibly above the sea level. Such changes in the continental character have been proposed to influence the Great Oxidation Event and, therefore, peeling-off plate tectonics could be the geodynamic trigger for this event. A transition to the slab break-off controlled syn-orogenic recycling occurred as the Earth aged and cooled, leading to reduced recycling and enhanced preservation of the continental crust of present-day composition.},

We estimate this deviation from the expected mean plane to be statistically significant at the {\$}\backslashsim97-99\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence level. We discuss several possible explanations for this deviation, including the possibility that a relatively close-in ({\$}a\backslashlesssim100{\$}{\~{}}au), unseen small planetary-mass object in the outer solar system is responsible for the warping.},

abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 planets are invaluable for the study of comparative planetary science outside our Solar System and possibly habitability. First, we derive from N-body simulations possible planetary evolution scenarios, and show that each of the planets are likely to be in synchronous rotation. We then use a 3-D Global Climate Model to explore the possible climates of cool planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In particular, we look at the conditions required for cool planets to prevent possible volatile species to be lost by permanent condensation, irreversible burying or photochemical destruction. We also explore the resilience of the same volatiles (when in condensed phase) to a runaway greenhouse process. We find that background atmospheres made of N2, CO or O2 are resistant to atmospheric collapse. However, it should be difficult for TRAPPIST-1 planets to accumulate significant greenhouse gases like CO2, CH4, or NH3. CO2 can easily condense on the nightside, forming glaciers that would flow toward the substellar region. A complete CO2 ice cover is possible on TRAPPIST-1g and h only, although CO2 ice deposits could be gravitationally unstable and get buried beneath the water ice shell in geologically short timescales. Given TRAPPIST-1 planets large EUV irradiation (at least 1000x Titan's flux), CH4 and NH3 should be photodissociated rapidly and thus be hard to accumulate in the atmosphere. Photochemical hazes could then sedimentate and form a surface layer of tholins. Regarding habitability, we confirm that few bars of CO2 would suffice to warm the surface of TRAPPIST-1f and g above the melting point of water. We also show that TRAPPIST-1e is a remarkable candidate for surface habitability. If the planet is today synchronous and abundant in water, then it should always sustain surface liquid water at least in the substellar region, whatever the atmosphere considered.},

Previous work using small differences in the shape of the transit light curve has been moderately successful, but was hampered by the small signal and extreme photometric precision required. The measurement of changes in transit depth, caused by the spin precession of an oblate planet, was proposed as an alternative method. Here, we present the first attempt to measure these changes. Using Kepler photometry, we examined the brown dwarf Kepler-39b and the warm Saturn Kepler-427b. We could not reliably constrain the oblateness of Kepler-39b. We find transit depth variations for Kepler-427b at {\$}90.1\backslash{\%}{\$} significance ({\$}1.65\backslashsigma{\$}) consistent with a precession period of {\$}P{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}prec{\}} = 5.45{\^{}}{\{}+0.46{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.37{\}}{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}years{\}}{\$} and an oblateness, {\$}f{\~{}}={\~{}}0.19{\^{}}{\{}+0.32{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.16{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {Laboratory analyses of lunar samples provide a direct means to identify indigenous volatiles and have been used to argue for the presence of Earth-like water content in the lunar interior. Some volatile elements, however, have been interpreted as evidence for a bulk lunar mantle that is dry. Here we demonstrate that, for a number of lunar pyroclastic deposits, near-infrared reflectance spectra acquired by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument onboard the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter exhibit absorptions consistent with enhanced OH- and/or H2O-bearing materials. These enhancements suggest a widespread occurrence of water in pyroclastic materials sourced from the deep lunar interior, and thus an indigenous origin. Water abundances of up to 150 ppm are estimated for large pyroclastic deposits, with localized values of about 300 to 400 ppm at potential vent areas. Enhanced water content associated with lunar pyroclastic deposits and the large areal extent, widespread distribution and variable chemistry of these deposits on the lunar surface are consistent with significant water in the bulk lunar mantle. We therefore suggest that water-bearing volcanic glasses from Apollo landing sites are not anomalous, and volatile loss during pyroclastic eruptions may represent a significant pathway for the transport of water to the lunar surface.},

This fact gives rise to an unphysical divergent behavior for the change of the specific heat at vaporization ($\Delta$vcv) near the critical point. An expression for the vapor-pressure equation with the appropriate critical behavior is proposed in terms of a truncated Renormalization Group (RG) expansion. As an example, it is shown that the well-known Wagner and Pruss vapor-pressure equation and the IAPWS-95 result for water yield an incorrect critical behavior for $\Delta$vcv whereas the RG equation, in agreement with the results of a crossover equation of state, provides the appropriate critical behavior. An application to the Ambrose-Walton vapor pressure equation is also presented.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Thermodynamic modeling alone cannot uniquely characterize the evolution path (T-P-t path) of a magmatic system, because the assumption of reaction reversibility precludes recovery of the history of that evolution from the final state that is preserved in the rock record. Nevertheless, as a tool for discriminating possible scenarios for magma evolution, such models are informative. This point is illustrated with two examples: The first involves modeling equilibrium and fractional crystallization of midocean ridge basalts. Attention is focused on the variation of intensive parameters (like oxygen fugacity) and heat output with crystallization, and how the latter can impact fluid dynamical modeling. The second example illustrates modeling mantle metling during closed-system adiabatic ascent. Here thermodynamic modeling leads to quantitative predictions of melt productivity, which may be used to interpret melt generation rates and chemical characteristics of lavas produced from volcanic centers.},

abstract = {The advanced rheological models of Andrade (1910) and Sundberg {\&} Cooper (2010) are compared to the traditional Maxwell model to understand how each affects the tidal dissipation of heat within rocky bodies. We find both the Andrade and Sundberg-Cooper rheologies can produce at least 10x the tidal heating compared to a traditional Maxwell model for a warm (1400--1600 K) Io-like satellite. Sundberg-Cooper is able to cause even larger dissipation around a critical temperature and frequency. Both advanced models allow cooler planets to stay tidally active in the face of orbital perturbations---a condition we term 'tidal resilience.' This has implications for the time evolution of tidally active worlds, and the long-term equilibria they fall into. We explore this by looking at the Laplace resonance amongst Io, Europa, and Ganymede. If Io is better modeled by the Andrade or Sundberg-Cooper models, then the Laplace resonance is no longer required, from a tidal perspective, to have occurred immediately after formation. Empirical parameters that define the Andrade anelasticity are examined in several phase spaces to provide guidance, as laboratory studies continue to constrain their real values. We provide detailed reference tables on the fully general equations required for others to insert the Andrade and Sundberg-Cooper models into standard tidal equations. Lastly, we find that realistic rheological models greatly impact the heating of heliocentric exoplanets, while the properties of tidal resilience, and fewer restrictions on resonance capture, can mean a greater number of tidally active worlds among all extrasolar systems.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of a recent origin of Saturn's rings and its mid-sized moons is actively debated. It was suggested that a proto-Rhea and a proto-Dione might have collided recently, giving birth to the modern system of mid-sized moons. It is also suggested that the rapid viscous spreading of the debris may have implanted mass inside Saturn's Roche limit, giving birth to the modern Saturn's ring system. However, this scenario has been only investigated in very simplified way for the moment. This paper investigates it in detail to assess its plausibility by using {\$}N{\$}-body simulations and analytical arguments. When the debris disk is dominated by its largest remnant, {\$}N{\$}-body simulations show that the system quickly re-accrete into a single satellite without significant spreading. On the other hand, if the disk is composed of small particles, analytical arguments suggest that the disk experiences dynamical evolutions in three steps. The disk starts significantly excited after the impact and collisional damping dominates over the viscous spreading. After the system flattens, the system can become gravitationally unstable when particles are smaller than {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 100 m. However, the particles grow faster than spreading. Then, the system becomes gravitationally stable again and accretion continues at a slower pace, but spreading is inhibited. Therefore, the debris is expected to re-accrete into several large bodies. In conclusion, our results show that such a scenario may not form the today's ring system. In contrast, our results suggest that today's mid-sized moons are likely re-accreted from such a catastrophic event.},

abstract = {We report Warm Spitzer full-orbit phase observations of WASP-12b at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. This extremely inflated hot Jupiter is thought to be overflowing its Roche lobe, undergoing mass loss and accretion onto its host star, and has been claimed to have a C/O ratio in excess of unity. We are able to measure the transit depths, eclipse depths, thermal and ellipsoidal phase variations at both wavelengths. The large-amplitude phase variations, combined with the planet's previously measured dayside spectral energy distribution, are indicative of non-zero Bond albedo and very poor day-night heat redistribution. The transit depths in the mid-infrared—( R p / R * ) 2 = 0.0123(3) and 0.0111(3) at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m, respectively—indicate that the atmospheric opacity is greater at 3.6 than at 4.5 $\mu$m, in disagreement with model predictions, irrespective of C/O ratio. The secondary eclipse depths are consistent with previous studies: F day / F * = 0.0038(4) and 0.0039(3) at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m, respectively. We do not detect ellipsoidal variations at 3.6 $\mu$m, but our parameter uncertainties—estimated via prayer-bead Monte Carlo—keep this non-detection consistent with model predictions. At 4.5 $\mu$m, on the other hand, we detect ellipsoidal variations that are much stronger than predicted. If interpreted as a geometric effect due to the planet's elongated shape, these variations imply a 3:2 ratio for the planet's longest:shortest axes and a relatively bright day-night terminator. If we instead presume that the 4.5 $\mu$m ellipsoidal variations are due to uncorrected systematic noise and we fix the amplitude of the variations to zero, the best-fit 4.5 $\mu$m transit depth becomes commensurate with the 3.6 $\mu$m depth, within the uncertainties. The relative transit depths are then consistent with a solar composition and short scale height at the terminator. Assuming zero ellipsoidal variations also yields a much deeper 4.5 $\mu$m eclipse depth, consistent with a solar composition and modest temperature inversion. We suggest future observations that could distinguish between these two scenarios.},

abstract = {Planets orbiting very close to their host stars have been found, some of them on the verge of tidal disruption. The ellipsoidal shape of these planets can significantly differ from a sphere, which modifies the transit light curves. Here we present an easy method for taking the effect of the tidal bulge into account in the transit photometric observations. We show that the differences in the light curve are greater than previously thought. When detectable, these differences provide us an estimation of the fluid Love number, which is invaluable information on the internal structure of close-in planets. We also derive a simple analytical expression to correct the bulk density of these bodies, that can be 20{\%} smaller than current estimates obtained assuming a spherical radius.},

@article{Leconte2011,
abstract = {We quantify the systematic impact of the non-spherical shape of transiting planets and brown dwarfs, due to tidal forces and rotation, on the observed transit depth. Such a departure from sphericity leads to a bias in the derivation of the transit radius from the light curve and affects the comparison with planet structure and evolution models which assume spherical symmetry. As the tidally deformed planet projects its smallest cross section area during the transit, the measured effective radius is smaller than the one of the unperturbed spherical planet. This effect can be corrected by calculating the theoretical shape of the observed planet. We derive simple analytical expressions for the ellipsoidal shape of a fluid object (star or planet) accounting for both tidal and rotational deformations and calibratre it with fully numerical evolution models in the 0.3Mjup-75Mjup mass range. Our calculations yield a 20{\%} effect on the transit depth, i.e. a 10{\%} decrease of the measured radius, for the extreme case of a 1Mjup planet orbiting a Sun-like star at 0.01AU. For the closest planets detected so far ({\textless} 0.05 AU), the effect on the radius is of the order of 1 to 10{\%}, by no means a negligible effect, enhancing the puzzling problem of the anomalously large bloated planets. These corrections must thus be taken into account for a correct determination of the radius from the transit light curve. Our analytical expressions can be easily used to calculate these corrections, due to the non-spherical shape of the planet, on the observed transit depth and thus to derive the planet's real equilibrium radius. They can also be used to model ellipsoidal variations of the stellar flux now detected in the CoRoT and Kepler light curves. We also derive directly usable analytical expressions for the moment of inertia, oblateness and Love number (k{\_}2) of a fluid planet as a function of its mass.},

The observable manifestations of oblatenesswould have been slight anomalies during the ingress and egress phases, as well as variations in the transit depth due to spin precession. Our nondetection of these effects gives the first empirical constraints on the shape of an exoplanet. The results are consistent with the theoretical expectation that the planetary rotation period and orbital period are synchronized, in which case the oblateness would be an order of magnitude smaller than our upper limits. Conversely, if HD 189733b is assumed to be in a synchronous, zero-obliquity state, then the data give an upper bound on the quadrupole moment of the planet (J2 {\textless} 0.068 with 95{\%} confidence) that is too weak to constrain the interior structure of the planet. An Appendix describes a fast algorithm for computing the transit light curve of an oblate planet, which was necessary for our analysis.},

We examine the assumption that such an effect is too minimal for rocky exoplanets and find that for smaller M Class stars there may be an observationally significant tidal distortion effect at very close-in orbits. We quantify the effect for different stellar types and planetary properties using some basic assumptions. Finally, we develop a simple analytic expression to test if there are detectable bulge signatures in the photometry of a system.

abstract = {The solar system gas giant planets are oblate due to their rapid rotation. A measurement of the planet's projected oblateness would constrain the planet's rotational period. Planets that are synchronously rotating with their orbital revolution will be rotating too slowly to be significantly oblate; these include planets with orbital semimajor axes {\textless}{\~{}}0.2 AU (for MP{\~{}}MJupiter and M*{\~{}}Msolar). Jupiter-like planets in the range of orbital semimajor axis 0.1 to 0.2 AU will tidally evolve to synchronous rotation on a timescale similar to main-sequence stars' lifetimes. In this case, an oblateness detection will help constrain the planet's tidal Q value. The projected oblateness of a transiting extrasolar giant planet is measurable from a very high photometric precision transit light curve. For a Sun-sized star and a Jupiter-sized planet, the normalized flux difference in the transit ingress/egress light curve between a spherical and an oblate planet is a few to 15×10-5 for oblateness similar to Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. The transit ingress and egress are asymmetric for an oblate planet with orbital inclination different from 90° and a nonzero projected obliquity. A photometric precision of 10-4 has been reached by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the known transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b. Kepler, a NASA discovery-class mission designed to detect transiting Earth-sized planets, requires a photometric precision of 10-5 and expects to find 30 to 40 transiting giant planets with orbital semimajor axes {\textless}1 AU, about 20 of which will be at {\textgreater}0.2 AU. Furthermore, part-per-million photometric precision (reached after averaging over several orbital periods) is expected from three other space telescopes to be launched within the next three years. Thus, an oblateness measurement of a transiting giant planet is realistic in the near future.},

@article{Brouwers2017,
abstract = {Context: Planet formation by pebble accretion is an alternative to classical core accretion. One of the main differences with classical core accretion is the increased thermal ablation rate experienced by pebbles. This changes the process of core growth. Aims: To describe and compute core growth in the pebble accretion model. We aim to predict core masses and compositions that can form by pebble accretion and compare them to the case of planetesimals. Methods: We have written a code containing both an impact and a planet evolution model to simulate the early growth of a proto-planet self-consistently. The region where high-Z material can exist in vapor form is determined by the temperature-dependent vapor pressure. We include enrichment effects by locally modifying the mean molecular weight of the envelope and determine when direct core growth of the planet terminates. Results: We have identified three phases of core growth in pebble accretion. In the first phase, pebbles impact the core without significant ablation. During the second phase, ablation becomes increasingly severe. A layer of high-Z vapor starts to form around the core that absorbs a small fraction of the ablated mass. The rest of the material either rains out to the core or mixes outwards instead, slowing core growth. In the third phase, the high-Z inner region expands outwards, absorbing an increasing fraction of the ablated material as vapor. Rainout ends before the core mass reaches 0.6 M{\_}Earth, terminating direct core growth. Conclusions: Our results indicate that pebble accretion can directly form rocky cores up to only 0.6 M{\_}Earth, and is unable to form icy cores. This result contrasts classical core accretion models, which can directly form massive cores of both rocky and icy compositions. Subsequent core growth can proceed indirectly when the planet cools, provided it is able to retain its high-Z material.},

abstract = {At the final stage of terrestrial planet formation, known as the giant impact stage, a few tens of Mars-sized protoplanets collide with one another to form terrestrial planets. Almost all previous studies on the orbital and accretional evolution of protoplanets in this stage have been based on the assumption of perfect accretion, where two colliding protoplanets always merge. However, recent impact simulations have shown that collisions among protoplanets are not always merging events, that is, two colliding protoplanets sometimes move apart after the collision (hit-and-run collision). As a first step toward studying the effects of such imperfect accretion of protoplanets on terrestrial planet formation, we investigated the merging criteria for collisions of rocky protoplanets. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic method, we performed more than 1000 simulations of giant impacts with various parameter sets, such as the mass ratio of protoplanets, $\gamma$, the total mass of two protoplanets, M T , the impact angle, $\theta$, and the impact velocity, v imp . We investigated the critical impact velocity, v cr , at the transition between merging and hit-and-run collisions. We found that the normalized critical impact velocity, v cr / v esc , depends on $\gamma$ and $\theta$, but does not depend on M T , where v esc is the two-body escape velocity. We derived a simple formula for v cr / v esc as a function of $\gamma$ and $\theta$ (Equation (16)), and applied it to the giant impact events obtained by N -body calculations in the previous studies. We found that 40{\%} of these events should not be merging events.},

The internal density distribution of a planet has a direct effect on the star-planet orbit through the gravitational quadrupole field created by the rotational and tidal bulges. These quadrupoles induce apsidal precession that is proportional to the planetary Love number ( k 2 p , twice the apsidal motion constant), a bulk physical characteristic of the planet that depends on the internal density distribution, including the presence or absence of a massive solid core. We find that the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge is the dominant source of apsidal precession for very hot Jupiters ( a {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {\{}lsim{\}} 0.025 AU), exceeding the effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces precession of a few degrees per year. By investigating the full photometric signal of apsidal precession, we find that changes in transit shapes are much more important than transit timing variations. With its long baseline of ultra-precise photometry, the space-based Kepler mission can realistically detect apsidal precession with the accuracy necessary to infer the presence or absence of a massive core in very hot Jupiters with orbital eccentricities as low as e {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {\{}sime{\}} 0.003.

abstract = {In the coming years, it is likely that the first potentially Earth-like planets will be discovered orbiting other stars. Once found, the characterisation of those planets will play a vital role in determining which will be chosen as the first targets for the search for life beyond the Solar System. We must thus be able to gauge the relative importance of the various factors proposed to influence potential planetary habitability, in order to best focus that search. One of the plethora of factors to be considered in that process is the climatic variability of the exo-Earths in question. In the Solar System, the Earth's long-term climate is driven by several factors, including the modifying influence of life on our atmosphere, and the temporal evolution of solar luminosity. The gravitational influence of the other planets in the Solar System adds an extra complication, driving the Milankovitch cycles that are thought to have caused the on-going series of glacial and interglacial periods that have dominated Earth's climate for the past few million years. Here we present preliminary results of three suites of integrations that together examine the influence of Solar System architecture on the Earth's Milankovitch cycles. We consider separately the influence of the planets Jupiter, Mars and Venus, each of which contributes to the forcing of Earth's orbital evolution. Our results illustrate how small changes to the architecture of a given planetary system can result in marked changes in the potential habitability of the planets therein, and are an important first step in developing a means by which the nature of climate variability on planets beyond our Solar System can be characterised.},

abstract = {Potentially habitable planets can orbit close enough to their host star that the differential gravity across their diameters can fix the rotation rate at a specific frequency, a process called tidal locking. Tidally locked planets on circular orbits will rotate synchronously, but those on eccentric orbits will either librate or rotate super-synchronously. I calculate how habitable planets evolve under two commonly-used models and find, for example, that one model predicts that the Earth's rotation rate would have synchronized after 4.5 Gyr if its initial rotation period was 3 days, it had no satellites, and it always maintained the modern Earth's tidal properties. Lower mass stellar hosts will induce stronger tidal effects on potentially habitable planets, and tidal locking is possible for most planets in the habitable zones of GKM dwarf stars. For fast rotating planets, both models predict eccentricity growth and that circularization can only occur once the rotational frequency is similar to the orbital frequency. The orbits of potentially habitable planets of very late M dwarfs ({\textless}0.15 solar masses) are very likely to be circularized within 1 Gyr and hence those planets will be synchronous rotators. Proxima b is almost assuredly tidally locked, but its orbit may not have circularized yet, so the planet could be rotating super-synchronously today. The evolution of the isolated and potentially habitable Kepler planet candidates is computed and about half could be tidally locked. Finally, projected TESS planets are simulated over a wide range of assumptions, and the vast majority of all cases are found to tidally lock within 1 Gyr. These results suggest that the process of tidal locking is a major factor in the evolution of most of the potentially habitable exoplanets to be discovered in the near future. [abridged]},

abstract = {A remarkable discovery from NASA's Kepler mission is the wide diversity in the average densities of planets that defy traditional planet formation theories. After the dissipation of gas disk, planets could interact with nearby planetesimals from a remnant planetesimal disk. Typical low planetary densities, their proximity to the host stars, and the high star-planet mass ratios often lead to planetesimal accretion by the planets as a result of these interactions. Here we present calculations using the open-source stellar evolution toolkit MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) modified to include the deposition of planetesimals into the hydrogen/helium envelopes of sub-Neptunes ({\~{}}sim 1-20 MEarth). We show that such accretion can alter the mass-radius isochrones for these planets. Due to the inherent stochasticity, the same initial planet as a result of the same total accreted mass of planetesimals can have average densities different by up to {\~{}}5{\%} several {\~{}}Gyr after the last accretion. Of course, during the active accretion period these differences are more dramatic. Furthermore, the additional energy deposition from the accreted planetesimals increases the ratio between the planet's radius to that of the core, which in turn leads to enhanced loss of atmospheric mass. Planet mean densities, long after the phase of high accretion rate are also altered by planetesimal accretion, especially for planets initially less massive than {\~{}}10 MEarth and with envelope mass fraction less than {\~{}}10{\%}. These results indicate that planetesimal accretion may be an important contributor in shaping the properties and diverse densities of sub-Neptune sized planets in addition to the more well-studied effects of photo-evaporation.},

abstract = {Chondrules in primitive meteorites likely formed by recrystallisation of dust aggregates that were flash-heated to nearly complete melting. Chondrules may represent the building blocks of rocky planetesimals and protoplanets in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, but the source of ubiquitous thermal processing of their dust aggregate precursors remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that escape of positrons released in the decay of the short-lived radionuclide {\$}{\^{}}{\{}26{\}}{\$}Al leads to a large-scale charging of dense pebble structures, resulting in neutralisation by lightning discharge and flash-heating of dust and pebbles. This charging mechanism is similar to a nuclear battery where a radioactive source charges a capacitor. We show that the nuclear battery effect operates in circumplanetesimal pebble discs. The extremely high pebble densities in such discs are consistent with conditions during chondrule heating inferred from the high abundance of sodium within chondrules. The sedimented mid-plane layer of the protoplanetary disc may also be prone to charging by the emission of positrons, if the mass density of small dust there is at least an order of magnitude above the gas density. Our results imply that the decay energy of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}26{\}}{\$}Al can be harvested to drive intense lightning activity in protoplanetary discs. The total energy stored in positron emission is comparable to the energy needed to melt all solids in the protoplanetary disc. The efficiency of transferring the positron energy to the electric field nevertheless depends on the relatively unknown distribution and scale-dependence of pebble density gradients in circumplanetesimal pebble discs and in the protoplanetary disc mid-plane layer.},

abstract = {The highest pressure form of the major Earth-forming mantle silicate is MgSiO3 post-perovskite (PPv). Understanding the fate of PPv at TPa pressures is the first step for understanding the mineralogy of super-Earths-type exoplanets, arguably the most interesting for their similarities with Earth. Modeling their internal structure requires knowledge of stable mineral phases, their properties under compression, and major element abundances. Several studies of PPv under extreme pressures support the notion that a sequence of pressure induced dissociation transitions produce the elementary oxides SiO2 and MgO as the ultimate aggregation form at {\~{}}3 TPa. However, none of these studies have addressed the problem of mantle composition, particularly major element abundances usually expressed in terms of three main variables, the Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios and the Mg{\#}, as in the Earth. Here we show that the critical compositional parameter, the Mg/Si ratio, whose value in the Earth's mantle is still debated, is a vital ingredient for modeling phase transitions and internal structure of super-Earth mantles. Specifically, we have identified new sequences of phase transformations, including new recombination reactions that depend decisively on this ratio. This is a new level of complexity that has not been previously addressed, but proves essential for modeling the nature and number of internal layers in these rocky mantles.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotopes in marine cherts have been used to infer hot oceans during the Archean with temperatures between 60 °C (333 K) and 80 °C (353 K). Such climates are challenging for the early Earth warmed by the faint young Sun. The interpretation of the data has therefore been controversial. 1D climate modeling inferred that such hot climates would require very high levels of CO2 (2–6 bars). Previous carbon cycle modeling concluded that such stable hot climates were impossible and that the carbon cycle should lead to cold climates during the Hadean and the Archean. Here, we revisit the climate and carbon cycle of the early Earth at 3.8 Ga using a 3D climate-carbon model. We find that CO2 partial pressures of around 1 bar could have produced hot climates given a low land fraction and cloud feedback effects. However, such high CO2 partial pressures should not have been stable because of the weathering of terrestrial and oceanic basalts, producing an efficient stabilizing feedback. Moreover, the weathering of impact ejecta during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) would have strongly reduced the CO2 partial pressure leading to cold climates and potentially snowball Earth events after large impacts. Our results therefore favor cold or temperate climates with global mean temperatures between around 8 °C (281 K) and 30 °C (303 K) and with 0.1–0.36 bar of CO2 for the late Hadean and early Archean. Finally, our model suggests that the carbon cycle was efficient for preserving clement conditions on the early Earth without necessarily requiring any other greenhouse gas or warming process.},

This valley may suggest a bimodal population of rocky planets that are either engulfed by massive gas envelopes that significantly enlarge their radius, or do not have detectable atmospheres at all. One explanation of such a bimodal distribution is atmospheric erosion by high-energy stellar photons. We investigate an alternative mechanism: the luminosity of the cooling rocky core, which can completely erode light envelopes while preserving heavy ones, produces a deficit of intermediate sized planets. We evolve planetary populations that are derived from observations using a simple analytical prescription, accounting self-consistently for envelope accretion, cooling and mass loss, and demonstrate that core-powered mass loss naturally reproduces the observed radius distribution, regardless of the high-energy incident flux. Observations of planets around different stellar types may distinguish between photoevaporation, which is powered by the high-energy tail of the stellar radiation, and core-powered mass loss, which depends on the bolometric flux through the planet's equilibrium temperature that sets both its cooling and mass-loss rates.},

abstract = {Ongoing and future space missions aim to identify potentially habitable planets in our Solar System and beyond. Planetary habitability is determined not only by a planet/'s current stellar insolation and atmospheric properties, but also by the evolutionary history of its climate. It has been suggested that icy planets and moons become habitable after their initial ice shield melts as their host stars brighten. Here we show from global climate model simulations that a habitable state is not achieved in the climatic evolution of those icy planets and moons that possess an inactive carbonate-silicate cycle and low concentrations of greenhouse gases. Examples for such planetary bodies are the icy moons Europa and Enceladus, and certain icy exoplanets orbiting G and F stars. We find that the stellar fluxes that are required to overcome a planet/'s initial snowball state are so large that they lead to significant water loss and preclude a habitable planet. Specifically, they exceed the moist greenhouse limit, at which water vapour accumulates at high altitudes where it can readily escape, or the runaway greenhouse limit, at which the strength of the greenhouse increases until the oceans boil away. We suggest that some icy planetary bodies may transition directly to a moist or runaway greenhouse without passing through a habitable Earth-like state.},

abstract = {Unraveling the conditions at which Earth's metallic iron core formed yields important information about Earth's early accretion and differentiation history. Multi-variable statistical modeling of siderophile element partitioning between core-forming metallic liquids and silicate melts form the basis for physical models of core formation. While it seems clear that core segregation in a deep peridotitic magma ocean is generally consistent with many mantle siderophile element abundances, there is considerable disparity among extant physical models in terms of the key parameters of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity at which the core formed. Moreover, there is ongoing debate over whether simple single-stage equilibrium or more complex multi-stage accretion models are required by the partitioning data. Here we consider how variations in the statistical regression of partitioning data affect the outcomes of physical models for core formation. Taking extant experimental data sets for four well-studied siderophile elements (Ni, Co, W and V) as examples, we find that the regression model exerts a fundamental control on physical model outcomes. Further, the experimental data are currently too imprecise to discriminate among various single-stage and continuous core formation scenarios. Progress in the development of physical models requires better isolation of the independent variables that affect partition coefficients and verification of activity models at high pressure and temperature in order to reduce the global uncertainty in multi-variable statistical models.},

abstract = {Solid state convection can take place in the rocky or icy mantles of planetary objects and these mantles can be surrounded above or below or both by molten layers of similar composition. A flow toward the interface can proceed through it by changing phase. This behaviour is modeled by a boundary condition involving a phase change dimensionless number, {\$}\backslashPhi{\$}, whose value controls whether the condition is the classical non-penetrative one ({\$}\backslashPhi\backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$}) or allows for a finite flow through the boundary (small {\$}\backslashPhi{\$}). We study Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'enard convection in a plane layer subject to this boundary condition at either or both its boundaries using linear and weakly non-linear analyses. When both boundaries are phase change interfaces with equal values of {\$}\backslashPhi{\$}, a non-deforming translation mode is possible with a critical Rayleigh number equal to {\$}24\backslashPhi{\$}. At small values of {\$}\backslashPhi{\$}, this mode competes with a weakly deforming mode having a slightly lower critical Rayleigh number and a very long wavelength {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c\backslashsim 8\backslashsqrt{\{}2{\}}\backslashpi/ 3\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashPhi{\}}{\$}. Both modes lead to very efficient heat transfer, as expressed by the relationship between the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers. When only one boundary is subject to a phase change condition, the critical Rayleigh number is {\$}\backslashmbox{\{}Ra{\}}{\_}c=153{\$} and the critical wavelength is {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}c=5{\$}. The Nusselt number increases about twice faster with Rayleigh number than in the classical case with non-penetrative conditions and the average temperature diverges from {\$}1/2{\$} when the Rayleigh number is increased, toward larger values when the bottom boundary is a phase change interface.},

abstract = {A large fraction of giant planets have gaseous envelopes that are limited to about 10 {\%} of their total mass budget. Such planets are present in the Solar System (Uranus, Neptune) and are frequently observed in short periods around other stars (the so-called Super-Earths). In contrast to these observations, theoretical calculations based on the evolution of hydrostatic envelopes argue that such low mass envelopes cannot be maintained around cores exceeding five Earth masses. Instead, under nominal disc conditions, these planets would acquire massive envelopes through runaway gas accretion within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc. In this work, we show that planetary envelopes are not in hydrostatic balance, which slows down envelope growth. A series of 3-dimensional, global, radiative hydrodynamical simulations reveal a steady state gas flow, which enters through the poles and exits in the disc midplane. Gas is pushed through the outer envelope in about 10 orbital timescales. In regions of the disc that are not significantly dust-depleted, envelope accretion onto cores of about five Earth masses can get stalled as the gas flow enters the deep interior. Accreted solids sublimate deep in the convective interior, but small opacity-providing grains are trapped in the flow and do not settle, which further prevents rapid envelope accretion. The transition to runaway gas accretion can however be reached when cores grow larger than typical Super-Earths, beyond 15 Earth masses, and preferably when disc opacities are below kappa=1 cm{\^{}}2/g. These findings offer an explanation for the typical low-mass envelopes around the cores of Super-Earths.},

abstract = {The population of close-in super-Earths, with gas mass fractions of up to 10{\%} represents a challenge for planet formation theory: how did they avoid runaway gas accretion and collapsing to hot Jupiters despite their core masses being in the critical range of {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}c{\}} \backslashsimeq 10 M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$}? Previous three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of low-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc, contrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this Paper we investigate the recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the evolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D atmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, potentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction. Recycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous studies. However, we also identify an "inner core" -- in size {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 25{\%} of the Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are needed to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically-isolated on long time-scales.},

@article{Hyodo2017a,
abstract = {Phobos and Deimos are the two small moons of Mars. Recent works have shown that they can accrete within an impact-generated disk. However, the detailed structure and initial thermodynamic properties of the disk are poorly understood. In this paper, we perform high-resolution SPH simulations of the Martian moon-forming giant impact that can also form the Borealis basin. This giant impact heats up the disk material (around {\$}\backslashsim 2000{\$} K in temperature) with an entropy increase of {\$}\backslashsim 1500{\$} J K{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} kg{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. Thus, the disk material should be mostly molten, though a tiny fraction of disk material ({\$}{\textless} 5\backslash{\%}{\$}) would even experience vaporization. Typically, a piece of molten disk material is estimated to be meter sized due to the fragmentation regulated by their shear velocity and surface tension during the impact process. The disk materials initially have highly eccentric orbits ({\$}e \backslashsim 0.6-0.9{\$}) and successive collisions between meter-sized fragments at high impact velocity ({\$}\backslashsim 3-5{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) can grind them down to {\$}\backslashsim100 \backslashmu{\$}m-sized particles. On the other hand, a tiny amount of vaporized disk material condenses into {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashmu{\$}m-sized grains. Thus, the building blocks of the Martian moons are expected to be a mixture of these different sized particles from meter-sized down to {\$}\backslashsim 100 \backslashmu{\$}m-sized particles and {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashmu{\$}m-sized grains. Our simulations also suggest that the building blocks of Phobos and Deimos contain both impactor and Martian materials (at least 35{\%}), most of which come from the Martian mantle (50-150 km in depth; at least 50{\%}). Our results will give useful information for planning a future sample return mission to Martian moons, such as JAXA's MMX (Martian Moons eXploration) mission.},

abstract = {Hypothetical exomoons around close-in giant planets may migrate inwards and/or outwards in virtue of the interplay of the star, planet and moon tidal interactions. These processes could be responsible for the disruption of lunar systems, the collision of moons with planets or could provide a mechanism for the formation of exorings. Several models have been developed to determine the fate of exomoons when subject to the tidal effects of their host planet. None of them have taken into account the key role that planetary evolution could play in this process. In this paper we put together numerical models of exomoon tidal-induced orbital evolution, results of planetary evolution and interior structure models, to study the final fate of exomoons around evolving close-in gas giants. We have found that planetary evolution significantly affects not only the time-scale of exomoon migration but also its final fate. Thus, if any change in planetary radius, internal mass distribution and rotation occurs in time-scales lower or comparable to orbital evolution, exomoon may only migrate outwards and prevent tidal disruption or a collision with the planet. If exomoons are discovered in the future around close-in giant planets, our results may contribute to constraint planetary evolution and internal structure models.},

abstract = {The planets of the Solar System divide neatly between those with atmospheres and those without when arranged by insolation ({\$}I{\$}) and escape velocity ({\$}v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}esc{\}}{\}}{\$}). The dividing line goes as {\$}I \backslashpropto v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}esc{\}}{\}}{\^{}}4{\$}. Exoplanets with reported masses and radii are shown to crowd against the extrapolation of the Solar System trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline that unites all the planets. The {\$}I \backslashpropto v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}esc{\}}{\}}{\^{}}4{\$} relation may implicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of hydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly-irradiated Extrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test because copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence requires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences ({\$}I{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}xuv{\}}{\}}{\$}) using proxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as {\$}I{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}xuv{\}}{\}} \backslashpropto v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}esc{\}}{\}}{\^{}}3\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashrho{\}}{\$}, which differs distinctly from the apparent {\$}I{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}xuv{\}}{\}} \backslashpropto v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}esc{\}}{\}}{\^{}}4{\$} relation. Energy-limited escape does provide good quantitative agreement to the highly irradiated EGPs. Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can lose more than 1{\%} of its mass as H{\$}{\_}2{\$}. Impact erosion, to the extent that impact velocities {\$}v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}imp{\}}{\}}{\$} can be estimated for exoplanets, fits to a {\$}v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}imp{\}}{\}} \backslashapprox 4\backslash,-\backslash,5\backslash, v{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}esc{\}}{\}}{\$} shoreline. The proportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in deep atmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is on the metaphorical beach. Known hazards include its rapid energetic accretion, high impact velocities, its early life on the wrong side of the runaway greenhouse, and Proxima Centauri's XUV radiation. In its favor is a vast phase space of unknown unknowns.},

Inertial modes are Coriolis-restored linear wave modes which often arise in rapidly rotating fluids. Recent experimental work has shown that inertial modes exist in a spherical Couette flow for {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}i{\}}{\textless}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}o{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}i{\$} and {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}o{\$} is the inner and outer sphere rotation rate. A finite number of particular inertial modes has previously been found. By scanning the Rossby number from {\$}-2.5 {\textless} Ro = (\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}i{\}}-\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}o{\}})/\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}o{\}} {\textless} 0{\$} at two fixed {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}o{\}}{\$}, we report the existence of similar inertial modes. However, the behavior of the flow described here differs much from previous spherical Couette experiments. We show that the kinetic energy of the dominant inertial mode dramatically increases with decreasing Rossby number that eventually leads to a wave-breaking and an increase of small-scale structures at a critical Rossby number. Such a transition in a spherical Couette flow has not been described before. The critical Rossby number scales with the Ekman number as0 {\$}E{\^{}}{\{}1/5{\}}{\$}. Additionally, the increase of small-scale features beyond the transition transfers energy to a massively enhanced mean flow around the tangent cylinder. In this context, we discuss an interaction between the dominant inertial modes with a geostrophic Rossby mode exciting secondary modes whose frequencies match the triadic resonance condition.},

abstract = {There is a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the terrestrial planets' water as well as the hydrated C-type asteroids. Here we show that the inner Solar System's water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets' formation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met for a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases, the orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally scattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a fraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior to Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with C-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5-20 AU-wide) region of the disk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach sufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and deliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on the giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant planet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich bodies.},

abstract = {Remote sensing of the atmospheres of distant worlds motivates a firm understanding of radiative transfer. In this review, we provide a pedagogical cookbook that describes the principal ingredients needed to perform a radiative transfer calculation and predict the spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere, including solving the radiative transfer equation, calculating opacities (and chemistry), iterating for radiative equilibrium (or not), and adapting the output of the calculations to the astronomical observations. A review of the state of the art is performed, focusing on selected milestone papers. Outstanding issues, including the need to understand aerosols or clouds and elucidating the assumptions and caveats behind inversion methods, are discussed. A checklist is provided to assist referees/reviewers in their scrutiny of works involving radiative transfer. A table summarizing the methodology employed by past studies is provided.},

abstract = {We create the first quantitative model for the early lunar atmosphere, coupled with a magma ocean crystallization model. Immediately after formation, the moon's surface was subject to a radiative environment that included contributions from the early Sun, a post-impact Earth that radiated like a mid-type M dwarf star, and a cooling global magma ocean. This radiative environment resulted in a largely Earth-side atmosphere on the Moon, ranging from {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}4{\$} to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} pascals, composed of heavy volatiles (Na and SiO). This atmosphere persisted through lid formation and was additionally characterized by supersonic winds that transported significant quantities of moderate volatiles and likely generated magma ocean waves. The existence of this atmosphere may have influenced the distribution of some moderate volatiles and created temperature asymmetries which influenced ocean flow and cooling. Such asymmetries may characterize young, tidally locked rocky bodies with global magma oceans and subject to intense irradiation.},

abstract = {The Earth is a thermal engine generating the fundamental processes of geomagnetic field, plate tectonics and volcanism. Large amounts of heat are permanently lost at the surface yielding the classic view of the deep Earth continuously cooling down. Contrary to this conventional depiction, we propose that the temperature profile in the deep Earth has remained almost constant for the last ∼4.3 billion years. The core–mantle boundary (CMB) has reached a temperature of ∼4400 K in probably less than 1 million years after the Moon-forming impact, regardless the initial core temperature. This temperature corresponds to an abrupt increase in mantle viscosity atop the CMB, when ∼60{\%} of partial crystallization was achieved, accompanied with a major decrease in heat flow at the CMB. Then, the deep Earth underwent a very slow cooling until it reached ∼4100 K today. This temperature at, or just below, the mantle solidus is suggested by seismological evidence of ultra-low velocity zones in the D”-layer. Such a steady thermal state of the CMB temperature excludes thermal buoyancy from being the predominant mechanism to power the geodynamo over geological time. An alternative mechanism to sustain the geodynamo is mechanical forcing by tidal distortion and planetary precession. Motions in the outer core are generated by the conversion of gravitational and rotational energies of the Earth–Moon–Sun system. Mechanical forcing remains efficient to drive the geodynamo even for a sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the outer core. Our thermal model of the deep Earth is compatible with an average CMB heat flow of 3.0 to 4.7 TW. Furthermore, the regime of core instabilities and/or secular changes in the astronomical forces could have supplied the lowermost mantle with a heat source of variable intensity through geological time. Episodic release of large amounts of heat could have remelted the lowermost mantle, thereby inducing the dramatic volcanic events that occurred during the Earth's history. In this scenario, because the Moon is a necessary ingredient to sustain the magnetic field, the habitability on Earth appears to require the existence of a large satellite.},

@article{Faccenda2017,
abstract = {With changing pressure and temperature conditions, downwelling and upwelling crustal and mantle rocks experience several solid–solid phase transitions that affect the mineral physical properties owing to structural changes in the crystal lattice and to the absorption or release of latent heat. Variations in density, together with phase boundary deflections related to the non-null reaction slope, generate important buoyancy forces that add to those induced by thermal perturbations. These buoyancy forces are proportional to the density contrast between reactant and product phases, their volume fraction, the slope and the sharpness of the reaction, and affect the style of mantle convection depending on the system composition. In a homogeneous pyrolitic mantle there is little tendency for layered convection, with slabs that may stagnate in the transition zone because of the positive buoyancy caused by post-spinel and post-ilmenite reactions, and hot plumes that are accelerated by phase transformations in the 600–800km depth range. By adding chemical and mineralogical heterogeneities as on Earth, phase transitions introduce bulk rock and volatiles filtering effects that generate a compositional gradient throughout the entire mantle, with levels that are enriched or depleted in one or more of these components. Phase transitions often lead to mechanical softening or hardening that can be related to a different intrinsic mechanical behaviour and volatile solubility of the product phases, the heating or cooling associated with latent heat, and the transient grain size reduction in downwelling cold material. Strong variations in viscosity would enhance layered mantle convection, causing slab stagnation and plume ponding. At low temperatures and relatively dry conditions, reactions are delayed due to the sluggish kinetics, so that non-equilibrium phase aggregates can persist metastably beyond the equilibrium phase boundary. Survival of low-density metastable olivine, Ringwoodite, pyroxene and pyrope garnet in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle produces positive buoyancy forces that decrease the subduction velocity and may lead to slab stagnation in the transition zone. The presence of deep metastable portions is still debated, and should not be associated a-priori with a completely dry slab as field observations suggest that heterogeneously hydrated oceanic plates could contain metastable dry portions surrounded by transformed wet rocks.},

abstract = {Understanding the ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) places constraints on the chemical composition and thermal structure of deep Earth and provides critical information on the dynamics of large-scale mantle convection, but their origin has remained enigmatic for decades. Recent studies suggest that metallic iron and carbon are produced in subducted slabs when they sink beyond a depth of 250 km. Here we show that the eutectic melting curve of the iron-carbon system crosses the current geotherm near Earth's core-mantle boundary, suggesting that dense metallic melt may form in the lowermost mantle. If concentrated into isolated patches, such melt could produce the seismically observed density and velocity features of ULVZs. Depending on the wetting behavior of the metallic melt, the resultant ULVZs may be short-lived domains that are replenished or regenerated through subduction, or long-lasting regions containing both metallic and silicate melts. Slab-derived metallic melt may produce another type of ULVZ that escapes core sequestration by reacting with the mantle to form iron-rich postbridgmanite or ferropericlase. The hypotheses connect peculiar features near Earth's core-mantle boundary to subduction of the oceanic lithosphere through the deep carbon cycle.},

abstract = {Abstract The Pluto–Charon system, likely formed from an impact, has reached the endpoint of its tidal evolution. During its evolution into the dual-synchronous state, the equilibrium tidal figures of Pluto and Charon would have also evolved as angular momentum was transferred from Pluto's spin to Charon's orbit. The rate of tidal evolution is controlled by Pluto's interior physical and thermal state. We examine three interior models for Pluto: an undifferentiated rock/ice mixture, differentiated with ice above rock, and differentiated with an ocean. For the undifferentiated case without an ocean, the Pluto–Charon binary does not evolve to its current state unless its internal temperature T i {\textgreater} 200 K , which would likely lead to strong tidal heating, melting, and differentiation. Without an ocean, Pluto's interior temperature must be higher than 240 K for Charon to evolve on a time scale less than the age of the Solar System. Further tidal heating would likely create an ocean. If New Horizons finds evidence of ancient tidally-driven tectonic activity on either body, the most likely explanation is that Pluto had an internal ocean during Charon's orbital evolution.},

We analytically study the ensuing coupled mass loss and orbital evolution during the Roche-lobe overflow and find two possible scenarios. Planets with light cores {\$}M{\_}c\backslashlesssim 6M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} (assuming a nominal tidal dissipation factor {\$}Q\backslashsim 10{\^{}}6{\$} for the host star) are transformed into Neptune-mass gas planets, orbiting at a separation (relative to the stellar radius) {\$}a/R{\_}\backslashstar\backslashapprox 3.5{\$}. Planets with heavier cores {\$}M{\_}c\backslashgtrsim 6M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} plunge rapidly until they are destroyed at the stellar surface. Remnant gas-Neptunes, which are stable to photo-evaporation, are absent from the observations, despite their unique transit radius ({\$}5-10R{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}). This result suggests that {\$}M{\_}c\backslashgtrsim 6M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}, providing a useful constraint on the poorly-known core mass that may distinguish between different formation theories of gas giants. Alternatively, if one assumes a prior of {\$}M{\_}c\backslashapprox 6 M{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} from the core-accretion theory, our results suggest that {\$}Q{\$} does not lie in the range {\$}10{\^{}}6\backslashlesssim Q\backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}7{\$}.},

abstract = {Planetary embryos form protoplanets via mutual collisions, which can lead to the development of magma oceans. During their solidification, large amounts of the mantles' volatile contents may be outgassed. The resulting H{\$}{\_}2{\$}O/CO{\$}{\_}2{\$} dominated steam atmospheres may be lost efficiently via hydrodynamic escape due to the low gravity and the high stellar EUV luminosities. Protoplanets forming later from such degassed building blocks could therefore be drier than previously expected. We model the outgassing and subsequent hydrodynamic escape of steam atmospheres from such embryos. The efficient outflow of H drags along heavier species (O, CO{\$}{\_}2{\$}, noble gases). The full range of possible EUV evolution tracks of a solar-mass star is taken into account to investigate the escape from Mars-sized embryos at different orbital distances. The envelopes are typically lost within a few to a few tens of Myr. Furthermore, we study the influence on protoplanetary evolution, exemplified by Venus. We investigate different early evolution scenarios and constrain realistic cases by comparing modeled noble gas isotope ratios with observations. Starting from solar values, consistent isotope ratios (Ne, Ar) can be found for different solar EUV histories, as well as assumptions about the initial atmosphere (either pure steam or a mixture with accreted H). Our results generally favor an early accretion scenario with a small amount of accreted H and a low-activity Sun, because in other cases too much CO{\$}{\_}2{\$} is lost during evolution, which is inconsistent with Venus' present atmosphere. Important issues are likely the time at which the initial steam atmosphere is outgassed and/or the amount of CO{\$}{\_}2{\$} which may still be delivered at later evolutionary stages. A late accretion scenario can only reproduce present isotope ratios for a highly active young Sun, but then very massive steam atmospheres would be required.},

abstract = {Minerals such as zircon can record the storage conditions of magma before volcanic eruption. Rubin et al. combined traditional 238U-230Th dating with lithium concentration profiles in seven zircons from the Taupo supervolcanic complex in New Zealand to determine magma storage conditions. The zircons spent more than 90{\%} of their lifetime in an uneruptible, mostly crystalline, and deep magmatic reservoir. The zircons were eventually transported to hotter, shallower, and eruptible magma bodies, where they spent only decades to hundreds of years before eruption. The result suggests a two-stage model for magmatic systems with large thermal variations.Science, this issue p. 1154Silicic volcanic eruptions pose considerable hazards, yet the processes leading to these eruptions remain poorly known. A missing link is knowledge of the thermal history of magma feeding such eruptions, which largely controls crystallinity and therefore eruptability. We have determined the thermal history of individual zircon crystals from an eruption of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Results show that although zircons resided in the magmatic system for 103 to 105 years, they experienced temperatures {\&}gt;650° to 750°C for only years to centuries. This implies near-solidus long-term crystal storage, punctuated by rapid heating and cooling. Reconciling these data with existing models of magma storage requires considering multiple small intrusions and multiple spatial scales, and our approach can help to quantify heat input to and output from magma reservoirs.},

abstract = {The Trans-Hudson orogen of North America is a circa 1,800 million year old, middle Palaeoproterozoic continental collisional belt. The orogen may represent an ancient analogue to the Himalayan orogen, which began forming 50 million years ago and remains active today. Both mountain belts exhibit similar length scales of deformation and timescales of magmatism and metamorphism. A notable divergence in this correlation has been the absence of high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic rocks in the Trans-Hudson compared with the Himalaya. It has been debated whether this absence reflects a secular tectonic change, with the requisite cool thermal gradients precluded by warmer ambient mantle temperatures during the Palaeoproterozoic, or a lack of preservation. Here we identify eclogite rocks within the Trans-Hudson orogen. These rocks, which typically form at high pressures and cool temperatures during subduction, fill the gap in the comparative geologic record between the Trans-Hudson and Himalayan orogens. Through the application of phase equilibria modelling and in situ U-Pb monazite dating we show that the pressure-temperature conditions and relative timing of eclogite-facies metamorphism are comparable in both orogenies. The results imply that modern-day plate tectonic processes featuring deep continental subduction occurred at least 1,830 million years ago. This study highlights that the global metamorphic rock record (particularly in older terrains) is skewed by overprinting and erosion.},

abstract = {The Acasta Gneiss Complex of the Northwest Territories, Canada, contains some of the earliest terrestrial continental crust and thus provides a critical sample set for characterization of crust-forming processes on the early Earth. Here we report the results of a combined Lu–Hf and U–Pb isotopic study of zircons from predominantly felsic orthogneisses from the Acasta Gneiss Complex that crystallized between ∼4.0 and 2.9 Ga, many of which contain complex zoning and therefore require an analytical treatment suited to distinguish amongst compositionally distinct age and Hf isotopic domains. To ensure the reliability of the analyses and of subsequent geologic interpretations, we employed the laser ablation split-stream (LASS) technique to concurrently measure the Lu–Hf and U–Pb isotopic systems in zircon. Our results confirm prior findings of precursor Hadean crust ({\textgreater}4.0 Ga) in the source of these rocks and the continued involvement of this reservoir until ∼3.6 Ga. We present evidence for the input of relatively more juvenile material at ∼3.6 Ga, which we suggest corresponds to a fundamental change in the source of the magmas. This study extends the lower bound of the published Acasta Hf isotopic record from 3.6 Ga to 2.9 Ga and demonstrates that the ∼3.6 Ga–2.9 Ga interval is largely represented by reworking of relatively juvenile ∼3.6 Ga crust and the diminution of the {\textgreater}4.0 Ga crustal signal. Significantly, there is no evidence that rocks within the Acasta Gneiss Complex were derived from a strongly depleted mantle.},

abstract = {The global geodynamic regime of early Earth, which operated before the onset of plate tectonics, remains contentious. As geological and geochemical data suggest hotter Archean mantle temperature 1,2 and more intense juvenile magmatism than in the present-day Earth 3,4 , two crust–mantle interaction modes differing in melt eruption efficiency have been proposed: the Io-like heat-pipe tectonics regime dominated by volcanism 5,6 and the " Plutonic squishy lid " tectonics regime governed by intrusive magmatism, which is thought to apply to the dynamics of Venus 7–9 . Both tectonics regimes are capable of producing primordial tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) continental crust 5,10 but lithospheric geotherms and crust production rates as well as proportions of various TTG compositions differ greatly 9,10 , which implies that the heat-pipe and Plutonic squishy lid hypotheses can be tested using natural data 11 . Here we investigate the creation of primordial TTG-like continental crust using self-consistent numerical models of global thermochemical convection associated with magmatic processes. We show that the volcanism-dominated heat-pipe tectonics model results in cold crustal geotherms and is not able to produce Earth-like primordial continental crust. In contrast, the Plutonic squishy lid tectonics regime dominated by intrusive magmatism results in hotter crustal geotherms and is capable of reproducing the observed proportions of various TTG rocks. Using a systematic parameter study, we show that the typical modern eruption efficiency of less than 40 per cent 12 leads to the production of the expected amounts of the three main primordial crustal compositions previously reported from field data 4,11 (low-, medium-and high-pressure TTG). Our study thus suggests that the pre-plate-tectonics Archean Earth operated globally in the Plutonic squishy lid regime rather than in an Io-like heat-pipe regime. To understand the global geodynamic regime of the Archean pre-plate-tectonics Earth an analytical explanation comparable to that of modern plate tectonics is needed, which can be validated and elaborated on using a continually expanding set of observational and analytical data 13,14},

abstract = {The age of Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, is still unknown. Gas-giant planet formation likely involved the growth of large solid cores, followed by the accumulation of gas onto these cores. Thus, the gas-giant cores must have formed before dissipation of the solar nebula, which likely occurred within less than 10 My after Solar System formation. Although such rapid accretion of the gas-giant cores has successfully been modeled, until now it has not been possible to date their formation. Here, using molybdenum and tungsten isotope measurements on iron meteorites, we demonstrate that meteorites derive from two genetically distinct nebular reservoirs that coexisted and remained spatially separated between ∼1 My and ∼3-4 My after Solar System formation. The most plausible mechanism for this efficient separation is the formation of Jupiter, opening a gap in the disk and preventing the exchange of material between the two reservoirs. As such, our results indicate that Jupiter's core grew to ∼20 Earth masses within {\textless}1 My, followed by a more protracted growth to ∼50 Earth masses until at least ∼3-4 My after Solar System formation. Thus, Jupiter is the oldest planet of the Solar System, and its solid core formed well before the solar nebula gas dissipated, consistent with the core accretion model for giant planet formation.},

abstract = {The Moon and the Earth's mantle share many chemical and isotopic traits, leading to the prevailing theory that they were formed from similar material. Iron is one element that shows apparent differences between the two bodies, with models for the composition of the Moon having ≈1.5 times more FeO (12–14 wt.{\%}), relative to the Earth's mantle (8 wt.{\%}). This difference is mirrored in their isotope compositions, where lunar mare basalts have $\delta$57Fe (per mille deviation of the 57Fe/54Fe ratio from the IRMM-014 standard) 0.1–0.2‰ higher than peridotitic rocks representative of Earth's mantle, a feature initially attributed to loss of isotopically light Fe following a giant impact. However, whether basaltic rocks are suitable analogues for the Moon's composition is debatable in the light of their distinct source regions that reflect the extensive lithological stratification of the lunar mantle. Here, we evaluate the iron isotope composition of the bulk Moon through the study of igneous cumulate rocks of the lunar highlands Magnesium Suite (Mg Suite). The $\delta$57Fe of Mg Suite rocks spans a limited range, from 0.05‰ to 0.10‰, with an average (+0.07±0.02‰) that overlaps with Earth's mantle (+0.05±0.01‰), similarities that extend to their Mg{\#}s, where both reach 0.9. Numerical modelling of iron isotope fractionation during lunar magma ocean crystallisation shows that the Mg Suite should accurately reflect the composition of the bulk Moon, which is therefore +0.07±0.02‰, indistinguishable from Earth's mantle but heavier than chondrites (−0.01±0.01‰). Iron thus behaves coherently with other elements that condense at temperatures higher than Li in showing no isotopic difference between the Earth and Moon, suggesting element depletion on the Moon affected only the more volatile elements. Therefore, there is no cosmochemical basis for iron enrichment or depletion in the bulk Moon relative to the Earth's mantle, whose composition is an analogue for that of the Moon.},

An improved method for the chemical purification of Rb for high-precision isotope ratio measurements by multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry. This method has been used to measure the Rb isotopic composition for a suite of planetary materials, including carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondrites, as well as achondrites (eucrite, angrite), terrestrial igneous rocks (basalt, andesite, granite), and Apollo lunar samples (mare basalts, alkali suite). Volatile depleted bodies (e.g. HED parent body, thermally metamorphosed meteorites) are enriched in the heavy isotope of Rb by up to several per mil compared to chondrites, suggesting volatile loss by evaporation at the surface of planetesimals. In addition, the Moon is isotopically distinct from the Moon in Rb. The variations in Rb isotope compositions in the volatile-poor samples are attributed to volatile loss from planetesimals during accretion. This suggests that either the Rb (and other volatile elements) were lost during or following the giant impact or by evaporation earlier during the accretion history of Theia.},

Samples from Earth, the Moon, Mars and the asteroid Vesta reveal significant variations in iron isotope ratios, but the sources of these variations remain uncertain. Here we present experiments that demonstrate that under the conditions of planetary core formation expected for the Moon, Mars and Vesta, iron isotopes fractionate between metal and silicate due to the presence of nickel, and enrich the bodies/' mantles in isotopically light iron. However, the effect of nickel diminishes at higher temperatures: under conditions expected for Earth/'s core formation, we infer little fractionation of iron isotopes. From our experimental results and existing conceptual models of magma ocean crystallization and mantle partial melting, we find that nickel-induced fractionation can explain iron isotope variability found in planetary samples without invoking nebular or accretionary processes. We suggest that near-chondritic iron isotope ratios of basalts from Mars and Vesta, as well as the most primitive lunar basalts, were achieved by melting of isotopically light mantles, whereas the heavy iron isotope ratios of terrestrial ocean floor basalts are the result of melting of near-chondritic Earth mantle.},

abstract = {Following giant impacts the early Hadean Earth was shrouded in a steam atmosphere for durations on the order of 1 Ma. In order to investigate the potential of this atmosphere to fractionate major elements between various silicate reservoirs and influence a planet's geochemical evolution, we performed experiments simulating the interaction of a post-giant-impact steam atmosphere with a bulk silicate Earth (BSE) composition. Our experiments indicate that the composition of the solute in a water-rich atmosphere at 10 MPa and ∼727 °C is remarkably similar to that of Earth's modern continental crust and would constitute up to 10{\%} of the solution mass. This solute composition is similar to solute compositions previously measured at higher pressures, but distinct from those of near-solidus peridotite melts. Mass balance calculations based upon the hypothesis that Earth's initial water concentration was similar to that in CI carbonaceous chondrites, and that degassing and metasomatism produced the BSE, indicate that metasomatism could produce from 10 to 300{\%} of the mass of the modern crust. If instead the amount of metasomatism is estimated by the difference between the water concentration in the BSE and in the depleted upper mantle, then a mass of up to approximately 4{\%} of the current crust could be produced by metasomatism. Using results of earlier research we find that the solute is expected to have a smaller Sm/Nd ratio than the residual BSE, and if the solute was formed early in Earth's history its Nd isotopic signatures would be highly enriched. Although we cannot be certain that the metasomatic process created a significant fraction of Earth's crust in the early Hadean, our research indicates that it has the potential to form crustal nuclei and possibly was responsible for the production of incompatible-element enriched reservoirs in the early Earth, as seen in the isotopic signatures of Archean rocks.},

Particle streams interacting with the gas within the Hill sphere of the protoplanet spiral into a prograde circumplanetary disc. Material is accreted on to the protoplanet due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings. We speculate that the trend for prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is primordial and that protoplanets accreted 10–50 per cent of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase. Our model also offers a possible explanation for the narrow range of spin periods observed among the largest bodies in the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, and predicts that 1000-km-scale Kuiper Belt objects that have not experienced giant impacts should preferentially spin in the prograde direction.},

abstract = {There is a clear correlation between downward projected large igneous province (LIP) eruption sites of the past 200 Myr and the margins of the large low-velocity provinces (LLVPs) at the base of the mantle. We established this correlation by using palaeomagnetic as well as fixed and moving hotspot reference frames. Our finding indicates that the majority of the LIPs have been generated by plumes that rose from the D″ zone at the edges of the LLVPs. Most LIP eruption sites project radially downwards to the core–mantle boundary (CMB) within ±10° of the 1 per cent slow shear wave velocity contour in the SMEAN tomographic model. Steep shear wave velocity gradients have been mapped near the CMB along much of the lengths of the LLVP margins close to that contour which marks a faster/slower boundary (FSB) within the D″ zone. The observation that eruption sites of LIPs as old as 200 Myr can be linked to this prominent present day seismic structure shows that the FSBs of the two LLVPs have occupied their current positions for at least as long and that the process that leads to the generation of deep-seated plumes has been localized on the FSBs at the margins of the African and Pacific LLVPs for the same interval. The persistence of the LLVPs over 200 Myr is consistent with independent evidence that they are compositionally distinct and are not just simply hotter than the material making up the rest of the D″ zone.},

abstract = {Variability of core-mantle boundary (CMB) structure is imaged at the kilometer to tens of kilometers scale by intensive waveform modeling of the ScP phase. Recordings of earthquakes in the Tonga-Fiji subduction zone from the small-aperture (10 km), high-frequency (∼2–4 Hz) Alice Springs Array in central Australia are used to document anomalous ScP waveform variations due to the presence of an ultralow-velocity zone (ULVZ) at the CMB. These data expand coverage from previous results using the Warramunga Array, which is located slightly to the north, and indicate the existence of a geographically confined ULVZ at the CMB, roughly 100 km in lateral extent, south of New Caledonia and east of Australia. Synthetic modeling indicates seismic velocity reductions of ∼8{\%} and ∼24{\%} for P wave and S waves, respectively, and a well-constrained density increase of ∼10{\%} in a ∼8.5 km thick layer above the CMB. This ULVZ patch is well explained by an elevated iron content of partially molten mantle material, likely present as divalent oxidized iron in the low spin state: The properties of such an iron-enriched assemblage are consistent with both an elevated density and bulk modulus of this region, as are dictated from our best fit seismic results. Furthermore, a positive velocity gradient within the ULVZ may be present, which need not be associated with a decrease in melt content within this region but could rather be associated with a shift in the textural distribution of melt within the ULVZ.},

@incollection{Rubie2007,
abstract = {The formation of the Earth's core is intimately linked to the manner in which the planet accreted. Small bodies (i.e., planetesimals), if they accreted sufficiently rapidly, may have melted and differentiated due to the decay of short-lived radioisotopes such as 26Al. For Earth-sized bodies, the final stages of accretion involved impacts between comparably sized objects, many of which were probably already differentiated. These impacts were sufficiently energetic to melt large portions of the planet, although the lateral extent of the melting and the lifetime of the resulting magma oceans are both currently poorly understood. Metal–silicate segregation, as required for core formation, can occur by several mechanisms depending on the degree of melting. The percolation of molten iron through solid silicates – which depends on the wetting properties of the melt (dihedral angle), melt fraction, and shear stress – is unlikely to be an efficient mechanism in an Earth-sized planet. In a magma ocean, on the other hand, the separation of molten iron from molten silicates is very rapid and efficient. Core formation itself releases gravitational energy and thus generates further heating. Thus, once the Earth grew sufficiently large, melting and core formation were inevitable. Because of the stochastic nature of late-stage impacts, large bodies of iron (the cores of planetesimals) were delivered to the Earth at discrete intervals. The extent to which these iron bodies emulsify during impacts is currently uncertain, but has important implications for the chemical evolution of the core and mantle. The hafnium–tungsten (Hf-W) chronometer has been used to constrain the core-formation time of the Earth to 30–50My after solar system formation. This timescale, though it cannot fully capture the growth of the core by multiple, discrete impacts, is in good agreement with numerical accretion models. The Hf–W results also suggest that the cores of impactors mostly re-equilibrated with the silicate mantle, suggesting that emulsification during impact is a relatively efficient process. Mantle siderophile element concentrations are higher than would be expected based on low-pressure partition coefficients. Metal–silicate partition coefficients determined at high P–T conditions (20–40GPa and 2500–4000K) can explain the abundances of moderately siderophile elements. These partition coefficients are again consistent with metal–silicate equilibration occurring near the base of a magma ocean, though the true picture is likely to involve multiple magma oceans with different (and evolving) conditions of pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity. The highly siderophile element concentrations may require the addition of chondritic material to the mantle (the ‘late veneer') after core formation ended; however, partition coefficients for such elements are still poorly known at likely core-formation conditions. The identity of the light element(s) in the core is currently uncertain, due mainly to the paucity of experiments at the required P–T conditions. As for the siderophile elements, the light-element content was likely set during core formation through metal–silicate partitioning. Based on cosmochemical arguments and recent numerical and laboratory studies, the major light element in the core is most likely oxygen, with ∼2wt.{\%} S and a small amount of Si.},

abstract = {Abstract The presence of Neon in terrestrial planet mantles may be attributed to the implantation of solar wind in planetary precursors or to the dissolution of primordial solar gases captured from the accretionary disk into an early magma ocean. This is suggested by the Neon isotopic ratio similar to those of the Sun observed in the Earth mantle. Here, we evaluate the second hypothesis. We use general considerations of planetary accretion and atmospheric science. Using current models of terrestrial planet formation, we study the evolution of standard planetary embryos with masses in a range of 0.1–0.2 MEarth, where MEarth is the Earth's mass, in an annular region at distances between 0.5 and 1.5 Astronomical Units from the star. We determine the characteristics of atmospheres that can be captured by such embryos for a wide range of parameters and calculate the maximum amount of Neon that can be dissolved in the planet. Our calculations may be directly transposed to any other planet. However, we only know of the amount of Neon in the Earth's solid mantle. Thus we use Earth to discuss our results. We find that the amount of dissolved Neon is too small to account for the present-day Neon contents of the Earth's mantle, if the nebular gas disk completely disappears before the largest planetary embryos grow to be ∼0.2 MEarth. This leaves solar irradiation as the most likely source of Neon in terrestrial planets for the most standard case of planetary formation models.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces and some hotspot volcanoes are thought to form above thermochemical anomalies known as mantle plumes. Petrologic investigations that support this model suggest that plume-derived melts originated at high mantle temperatures (greater than 1,500[thinsp][deg]C) relative to those generated at ambient mid-ocean ridge conditions (about 1,350[thinsp][deg]C). Earth/'s mantle has also cooled appreciably during its history and the temperatures of modern mantle derived melts are substantially lower than those produced during the Archaean (2.5 to 4.0 billion years ago), as recorded by komatiites (greater than 1,700[thinsp][deg]C). Here we use geochemical analyses of the Tortugal lava suite to show that these Galapagos-Plume-related lavas, which formed 89 million years ago, record mantle temperatures as high as Archaean komatiites and about 400[thinsp][deg]C hotter than the modern ambient mantle. These results are also supported by highly magnesian olivine phenocrysts and Al-in-olivine crystallization temperatures of 1,570 [plusmn] 20[thinsp][deg]C. As mantle plumes are chemically and thermally heterogeneous, we interpret these rocks as the result of melting the hot core of the plume head that produced the Caribbean large igneous province. Our results imply that a mantle reservoir as hot as those responsible for some Archaean lavas has survived eons of convection in the deep Earth and is still being tapped by mantle plumes.},

abstract = {Constraints on the formation history of the Earth are critical for understanding of planet formation processes. (182)Hf-(182)W chronometry of terrestrial rocks points to accretion of Earth in approximately 30 Myr after the formation of the solar system, immediately followed by the Moon-forming giant impact (MGI). Nevertheless, some N-body simulations and (182)Hf-(182)W and (87)Rb-(87)Sr chronology of some lunar rocks have been used to argue for a later formation of the Moon at 52 to {\textgreater} 100 Myr. This discrepancy is often explained by metal-silicate disequilibrium during giant impacts. Here we describe a model of the (182)W isotopic evolution of the accreting Earth, including constraints from partitioning of refractory siderophile elements (Ni, Co, W, V, and Nb) during core formation, which can explain the discrepancy. Our modeling shows that the concentrations of the siderophile elements of the mantle are consistent with high-pressure metal-silicate equilibration in a terrestrial magma ocean. Our analysis shows that the timing of the MGI is inversely correlated with the time scale of the main accretion stage of the Earth. Specifically, the earliest time the MGI could have taken place right at approximately 30 Myr, corresponds to the end of main-stage accretion at approximately 30 Myr. A late MGI ({\textgreater} 52 Myr) requires the main stage of the Earth's accretion to be completed rapidly in {\textless} 10.7 ± 2.5 Myr. These are the two end member solutions and a continuum of solutions exists in between these extremes.},

@article{Carballido2016,
abstract = {We perform the first study of magnetohydrodynamic processes in the protolunar disk (PLD). With the use of published data on the chemical composition of the PLD, along with existing analytical models of the disk structure, we show that the high temperatures that were prevalent in the disk would have led to ionization of Na, K, SiO, Zn and, to a lesser extent, O2. For simplicity, we assume that the disk has a vapor structure. The resulting ionization fractions, together with a relatively weak magnetic field, possibly of planetary origin, would have been sufficient to trigger the magneto-rotational instability, or MRI, as demonstrated by the fact that the Elsasser criterion was met in the PLD: a magnetic field embedded in the flow would have diffused more slowly than the growth rate of the linear perturbations. We calculate the intensity of the resulting magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, as parameterized by the dimensionless ratio $\alpha$ of turbulent stresses to gas pressure, and obtain maximum values $\alpha$∼10-2 along most of the vertical extent of the disk, and at different orbital radii. This indicates that, under these conditions, turbulent mixing within the PLD due to the MRI was likely capable of transporting isotopic and chemical species efficiently. To test these results in a conservative manner, we carry out a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a small, rectangular patch of the PLD, located at 4 Earth radii (rE) from the center of the Earth, and assuming once again that the disk is completely gaseous. We use a polytrope-like equation of state. The rectangular patch is threaded initially by a vertical magnetic field with zero net magnetic flux. This field configuration is known to produce relatively weak MRI turbulence in studies of astrophysical accretion disks. We accordingly obtain turbulence with an average intensity $\alpha$∼7×10-6 over the course of 280 orbital periods (133days at 4rE). Despite this relatively low value of $\alpha$, the effective turbulent diffusivity D∼1010-1011cm2s−1 of a passive tracer introduced in the flow is large enough to allow the tracer to spread across a radial distance of 10rE in ∼13–129yr, less than the estimated cooling time of the PLD of ∼250yr. Further improvements to our model will need to incorporate the energy balance in the disk, a complete two-phase structure, and a more realistic equation of state.},

abstract = {The inception of plate tectonics on Earth and its subsequent evolution are discussed on the basis of theoretical considerations and observational constraints. The likelihood of plate tectonics in the past depends on what mechanism is responsible for the relatively constant surface heat flux that is indicated by the likely thermal history of Earth. The continuous operation of plate tectonics throughout Earth's history is possible if, for example, the strength of convective stress in the mantle is affected by the gradual subduction of surface water. Various geological indicators for the emergence of plate tectonics are evaluated from a geodynamical perspective, and they invariably involve certain implicit assumptions about mantle dynamics, which are either demonstrably wrong or yet to be explored. The history of plate tectonics is suggested to be intrinsically connected to the secular evolution of the atmosphere, through sea-level changes caused by ocean-mantle interaction.},

abstract = {The Earth was born in violence. Many giant collisions of protoplanets are thought to have occurred during the terrestrial planet formation. Here we investigated the giant impact stage by using a hybrid code that consistently deals with the orbital evolution of protoplanets around the Sun and the details of processes during giant impacts between two protoplanets. A significant amount of materials (up to several tens of percent of the total mass of the protoplanets) is ejected by giant impacts. We call these ejected fragments the giant-impact fragments (GIFs). In some of the erosive hit-and-run and high-velocity collisions, metallic iron is also ejected, which comes from the colliding protoplanets' cores. From ten numerical simulations for the giant impact stage, we found that the mass fraction of metallic iron in GIFs ranges from ∼1 wt{\%} to ∼25 wt{\%}. We also discussed the effects of the GIFs on the dynamical and geochemical characteristics of formed terrestrial planets. We found that the GIFs have the potential to solve the following dynamical and geochemical conflicts: (1) The Earth, currently in a near circular orbit, is likely to have had a highly eccentric orbit during the giant impact stage. The GIFs are large enough in total mass to lower the eccentricity of the Earth to its current value via their dynamical friction. (2) The concentrations of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the Earth's mantle are greater than what was predicted experimentally. Re-accretion of the iron-bearing GIFs onto the Earth can contribute to the excess of HSEs. In addition, Iron-bearing GIFs provide significant reducing agent that could transform primitive CO2–H2O atmosphere and ocean into more reducing H2-bearing atmosphere. Thus, GIFs are important for the origin of Earth's life and its early evolution.},

Spectral analysis indicates that the dominant scale length of the heterogeneity is 4 to 7 km. The heterogeneity distribution varies laterally and radially and heterogeneities are more abundant near the margins of the lowermost mantle Large Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs), consistent with mantle convection simulations that show elevated accumulations of deeply advected crustal material near the boundaries of thermo-chemical piles. The size and distribution of the observed heterogeneities is consistent with that expected for subducted oceanic crust. These results thus suggest the deep mantle contains an imprint of continued subduction of oceanic crust, stirred by mantle convection and modulated by long lasting thermo-chemical structures. The preferred location of the heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle is consistent with a thermo-chemical origin of the LLVPs. Our observations relate to the mixing behaviour of small length-scale heterogeneity in the deep Earth and indicate that compositional heterogeneities from the subduction process can survive for extended times in the lowermost mantle.},

abstract = {The concept of Late Veneer has been introduced by the geochemical community to explain the abundance of highly siderophile elements in the Earth's mantle and their chondritic proportions relative to each other. However, in the complex scenario of Earth accretion, involving both planetesimal bombardment and giant impacts from chondritic and differentiated projectiles, it is not obvious what the "Late Veneer" actually corresponds to. In fact, the process of differentiation of the Earth was probably intermittent and there was presumably no well-defined transition between an earlier phase where all metal sunk into the core and a later phase in which the core was a closed entity separated from the mantle. In addition, the modellers of Earth accretion have introduced the concept of "Late Accretion", which refers to the material accreted by our planet after the Moon-forming event. Characterising Late Veneer, Late Accretion and the relationship between the two is the major goal of this chapter.},

abstract = {Why Venus lacks plate tectonics remains an unanswered question in terrestrial planet evolution. There is observational evidence for subduction[mdash]a requirement for plate tectonics[mdash]on Venus, but it is unclear why the features have characteristics of both mantle plumes and subduction zones. One explanation is that mantle plumes trigger subduction. Here we compare laboratory experiments of plume-induced subduction in a colloidal solution of nanoparticles to observations of proposed subduction sites on Venus. The experimental fluids are heated from below to produce upwelling plumes, which in turn produce tensile fractures in the lithosphere-like skin that forms on the upper surface. Plume material upwells through the fractures and spreads above the skin, analogous to volcanic flooding, and leads to bending and eventual subduction of the skin along arcuate segments. The segments are analogous to the semi-circular trenches seen at two proposed sites of plume-triggered subduction at Quetzalpetlatl and Artemis coronae. Other experimental deformation structures and subsurface density variations are also consistent with topography, radar and gravity data for Venus. Scaling analysis suggests that this regime with limited, plume-induced subduction is favoured by a hot lithosphere, such as that found on early Earth or present-day Venus.},

abstract = {The oldest known samples of Earth, with ages of up to 4.4[thinsp]Gyr, are detrital zircon grains in meta-sedimentary rocks of the Jack Hills in Australia. These zircons offer insights into the magmas from which they crystallized, and, by implication, igneous activity and tectonics in the first 500 million years of Earth[rsquor]s history, the Hadean eon. However, the compositions of these magmas and the relative contributions of igneous and sedimentary components to their sources have not yet been resolved. Here we compare the trace element concentrations of the Jack Hills zircons to those of zircons from the locality where igneous (I-) and sedimentary (S-) type granites were first distinguished. We show that the Hadean zircons crystallized predominantly from I-type magmas formed by melting of a reduced, garnet-bearing igneous crust. Further, we propose that both the phosphorus content of zircon and the ratio of phosphorus to rare earth elements can be used to distinguish between detrital zircon grains from I- and S-type sources. These elemental discriminants provide a new geochemical tool to assess the relative contributions of primeval magmatism and melting of recycled sediments to the continents over geological time.},

Following earlier work by Charnoz and Michaut, and Carballido et al., we show that once the disk is completely vaporized it is well coupled to the magnetic field. We consider a scenario in which turbulence driven by magnetic fields leads to a brief, hot phase where the disk is geometrically thick, wit h strong turbulent mixing. The disk cools by spreading until it decouples from the field. We point out that approximately half the accretion energy is dissipated in the boundary layer where the disk meets the Earth's surface. This creates high entropy material close to the Earth, driving convection and mixing. Finally, a hot, magnetized disk could drive bipolar outflows that remove mass and angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system.},

abstract = {Earth's volatile elements (H, C, and N) are essential to maintaining habitable conditions for metazoans and simpler life forms. However, identifying the sources (comets, meteorites, and trapped nebular gas) that supplied volatiles to Earth is not straightforward because secondary processes like mantle degassing, crustal recycling, and escape to space modified the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we review two complementary approaches to investigate the origin of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The geochemical approach uses volatile element abundances and isotopic compositions to identify the possible contributors to the atmosphere and to disentangle the processes that shaped it. In that respect, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe), elements that are chemically inert and possess several isotopes produced by radioactivity, play a critical role. The dynamical approach uses our knowledge of planetary dynamics to track volatile delivery to the Earth, starting with dust transport in the disk to planet-building processes. The main conclusion is that Earth acquired most of its major volatile elements by accretion of planetesimals or embryos akin to volatile-rich meteorites. At the same time, solar/meteoritic noble gases were captured by embryos and some gases were lost to space, by hydrodynamic escape and large impacts. Comets did not contribute much H, C, and N but may have delivered significant noble gases, which could represent the only fingerprints of the bombardment of our planet with icy bodies. The processes that governed the delivery of volatile elements to the Earth are thought to be relatively common and it is likely that Earth-like planets covered with oceans exist in extra-solar systems.},

abstract = {Giant impacts refer to collisions between two objects each of which is massive enough to be considered at least a planetary embryo. The putative collision suffered by the proto-Earth that created the Moon is a prime example, though most Solar System bodies bear signatures of such collisions. Current planet formation models predict that an epoch of giant impacts may be inevitable, and observations of debris around other stars are providing mounting evidence that giant impacts feature in the evolution of many planetary systems. This chapter reviews giant impacts, focussing on what we can learn about planet formation by studying debris around other stars. Giant impact debris evolves through mutual collisions and dynamical interactions with planets. General aspects of this evolution are outlined, noting the importance of the collision-point geometry. The detectability of the debris is discussed using the example of the Moon-forming impact. Such debris could be detectable around another star up to 10 Myr post-impact, but model uncertainties could reduce detectability to a few 100 yr window. Nevertheless the 3 {\{}{\%}{\}} of young stars with debris at levels expected during terrestrial planet formation provide valuable constraints on formation models; implications for super-Earth formation are also discussed. Variability recently observed in some bright disks promises to illuminate the evolution during the earliest phases when vapour condensates may be optically thick and acutely affected by the collision-point geometry. The outer reaches of planetary systems may also exhibit signatures of giant impacts, such as the clumpy debris structures seen around some stars.},

abstract = {Water-rich super-Earth exoplanets are expected to be common. We explore the effect of late giant impacts on the final bulk abundance of water in such planets. We present the results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of impacts between differentiated water(ice)-rock planets with masses between 0.5 and 5 M ⊕ and projectile to target mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. We find that giant impacts between bodies of similar composition never decrease the bulk density of the target planet. If the commonly assumed maximum water fraction of 75 wt{\%} for bodies forming beyond the snow line is correct, giant impacts between similar composition bodies cannot serve as a mechanism for increasing the water fraction. Target planets either accrete materials in the same proportion, leaving the water fraction unchanged, or lose material from the water mantle, decreasing the water fraction. The criteria for catastrophic disruption of water-rock planets are similar to those found in previous work on super-Earths of terrestrial composition. Changes in bulk composition for giant impacts onto differentiated bodies of any composition (water rock or rock iron) are described by the same equations. These general laws can be incorporated into future N-body calculations of planet formation to track changes in composition from giant impacts.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the great outstanding problems of astrophysics. Within the broad context of hierachical structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to) elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding. Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step toward achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {Isotopic variations usually follow mass-dependent fractionation, meaning that the relative variations in isotopic ratios scale with the difference in mass of the isotopes involved (e.g., $\delta$17O ≈ 0.5×$\delta$18O). In detail, however, the mass dependence of isotopic variations is not always the same, and different natural processes can define distinct slopes in three-isotope diagrams. These variations are subtle, but improvements in analytical capabilities now allow precise measurement of these effects and make it possible to draw inferences about the natural processes that caused them (e.g., reaction kinetics versus equilibrium isotope exchange). Some elements, in some sample types, do not conform to the regularities of mass-dependent fractionation. Oxygen and sulfur display a rich phenomenology of mass-independent fractionation, documented in the laboratory, in the rock record, and in the modern atmosphere. Oxygen in meteorites shows isotopic variations that follow a slope-one line ($\delta$17O ≈ $\delta$18O) whose origin may ...},

abstract = {The Earth and other terrestrial planets formed through the accretion of smaller bodies, with their core and mantle compositions primarily set by metal–silicate interactions during accretion. The conditions of these interactions are poorly understood, but could provide insight into the mechanisms of planetary core formation and the composition of Earth's core. Here we present modeling of Earth's core formation, combining results of 100 N-body accretion simulations with high pressure–temperature metal–silicate partitioning experiments. We explored how various aspects of accretion and core formation influence the resulting core and mantle chemistry: depth of equilibration, amounts of metal and silicate that equilibrate, initial distribution of oxidation states in the disk, temperature distribution in the planet, and target:impactor ratio of equilibrating silicate. Virtually all sets of model parameters that are able to reproduce the Earth's mantle composition result in at least several weight percent of both silicon and oxygen in the core, with more silicon than oxygen. This implies that the core's light element budget may be dominated by these elements, and is consistent with ≤1–2 wt{\%} of other light elements. Reproducing geochemical and geophysical constraints requires that Earth formed from reduced materials that equilibrated at temperatures near or slightly above the mantle liquidus during accretion. The results indicate a strong tradeoff between the compositional effects of the depth of equilibration and the amounts of metal and silicate that equilibrate, so these aspects should be targeted in future studies aiming to better understand core formation conditions. Over the range of allowed parameter space, core and mantle compositions are most sensitive to these factors as well as stochastic variations in what the planet accreted as a function of time, so tighter constraints on these parameters will lead to an improved understanding of Earth's core composition.},

abstract = {The Dawn mission confirms earlier predictions that the asteroid 4 Vesta is differentiated with an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle and a basaltic crust, and supports the conjecture of Vesta being the parent body of the HED meteorites. To better understand its early evolution, we perform numerical calculations of the thermo-chemical evolution adopting new data obtained by the Dawn mission such as mass, bulk density and size of the asteroid. We have expanded the thermo-chemical evolution model of Neumann et al. (2012) that includes accretion, compaction, melting and the associated changes of the material properties and the partitioning of incompatible elements such as the radioactive heat sources, advective heat transport, and differentiation by porous flow, to further consider convection and the associated effective cooling in a potential magma ocean. Depending on the melt fraction, the heat transport by melt segregation is modelled either by assuming melt flow in a porous medium or by simulating vigorous convection and heat flux of a magma ocean with a high effective thermal conductivity. Our results show that partitioning of 26Al and its transport with the silicate melt is crucial for the formation of a global and deep magma ocean. Due to the enrichment of 26Al in the liquid phase and its accumulation in the sub-surface (for formation times t0{\textless}1.5 Ma), a thin shallow magma ocean with a thickness of 1 to a few tens of km forms – its thickness depends on the viscosity of silicate melt. The lifetime of the shallow magma ocean is O(104)–O(106) years and convection in this layer is accompanied by the extrusion of 26Al at the surface, resulting in the formation of a basaltic crust. The interior differentiates from the outside inwards with a mantle that is depleted in 26Al and core formation is completed within ∼0.3 Ma. The lower mantle experiences a maximal melt fraction of 45{\%} suggesting a harzburgitic to dunitic composition. Our results support the formation of non-cumulate eucrites by the extrusion of early partial melt while cumulate eucrites and diogenites may form from the crystallising shallow magma ocean. Silicate melt is present in the mantle for up to 150 Ma, and convection in a crystallising core proceeds for approximately 100 Ma, supporting the idea of an early magnetic field to explain the remnant magnetisation observed in some HED meteorites.},

abstract = {We use the C/N ratio as a monitor of the delivery of key ingredients of life to nascent terrestrial worlds. Total elemental C and N contents, and their ratio, are examined for the interstellar medium, comets, chondritic meteorites, and terrestrial planets; we include an updated estimate for the bulk silicate Earth (C/N = 49.0 ± 9.3). Using a kinetic model of disk chemistry, and the sublimation/condensation temperatures of primitive molecules, we suggest that organic ices and macromolecular (refractory or carbonaceous dust) organic material are the likely initial C and N carriers. Chemical reactions in the disk can produce nebular C/N ratios of ∼1-12, comparable to those of comets and the low end estimated for planetesimals. An increase of the C/N ratio is traced between volatile-rich pristine bodies and larger volatile-depleted objects subjected to thermal/accretional metamorphism. The C/N ratios of the dominant materials accreted to terrestrial planets should therefore be higher than those seen in carbonaceous chondrites or comets. During planetary formation, we explore scenarios leading to further volatile loss and associated C/N variations owing to core formation and atmospheric escape. Key processes include relative enrichment of nitrogen in the atmosphere and preferential sequestration of carbon by the core. The high C/N bulk silicate Earth ratio therefore is best satisfied by accretion of thermally processed objects followed by large-scale atmospheric loss. These two effects must be more profound if volatile sequestration in the core is effective. The stochastic nature of these processes hints that the surface/atmospheric abundances of biosphere-essential materials will likely be variable.},

abstract = {Compositional convection driven by precipitating solids or immiscible liquids has been invoked as a dynamo mechanism in planets and satellites throughout the solar system, including Mercury, Ganymede, and the Earth. Here we report laboratory experiments on turbulent rain-driven convection, analogs for the flows generated by precipitation within planetary fluid interiors. We subject a two-layer fluid to a uniform intensity rainfall, in which the rain is immiscible in the upper layer and miscible in the lower layer. Rain falls through the upper layer and accumulates as a two-fluid emulsion in the interfacial region between the layers. In experiments where the rain is denser than the lower fluid, rain-injected vortices evolve into small-scale plumes that rapidly coalesce into larger structures, resulting in turbulent convection throughout the lower layer. The turbulent convective velocity in our experiments increases approximately as the cube root of the rain buoyancy flux, implying little or no dependence on viscous and chemical diffusivities. Applying diffusion-free scaling laws for magnetic field generation, we find that precipitation-driven convection can be an effective dynamo mechanism in planetary cores provided the precipitation buoyancy flux is large and the convecting region is deep and nearly adiabatic.},

abstract = {The Dawn mission confirms earlier predictions that the asteroid 4 Vesta is differentiated with an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle and a basaltic crust, and supports the conjecture of Vesta being the parent body of the HED meteorites. To better understand its early evolution, we perform numerical calculations of the thermo-chemical evolution adopting new data obtained by the Dawn mission such as mass, bulk density and size of the asteroid. We have expanded the thermo-chemical evolution model of Neumann et al. (2012) that includes accretion, compaction, melting and the associated changes of the material properties and the partitioning of incompatible elements such as the radioactive heat sources, advective heat transport, and differentiation by porous flow, to further consider convection and the associated effective cooling in a potential magma ocean. Depending on the melt fraction, the heat transport by melt segregation is modelled either by assuming melt flow in a porous medium or by simulating vigorous convection and heat flux of a magma ocean with a high effective thermal conductivity. Our results show that partitioning of 26Al and its transport with the silicate melt is crucial for the formation of a global and deep magma ocean. Due to the enrichment of 26Al in the liquid phase and its accumulation in the sub-surface (for formation times t0{\textless}1.5 Ma), a thin shallow magma ocean with a thickness of 1 to a few tens of km forms – its thickness depends on the viscosity of silicate melt. The lifetime of the shallow magma ocean is O(104)–O(106) years and convection in this layer is accompanied by the extrusion of 26Al at the surface, resulting in the formation of a basaltic crust. The interior differentiates from the outside inwards with a mantle that is depleted in 26Al and core formation is completed within ∼0.3 Ma. The lower mantle experiences a maximal melt fraction of 45{\%} suggesting a harzburgitic to dunitic composition. Our results support the formation of non-cumulate eucrites by the extrusion of early partial melt while cumulate eucrites and diogenites may form from the crystallising shallow magma ocean. Silicate melt is present in the mantle for up to 150 Ma, and convection in a crystallising core proceeds for approximately 100 Ma, supporting the idea of an early magnetic field to explain the remnant magnetisation observed in some HED meteorites.},

abstract = {Several features of Earth owe their origin to processes occurring during and shortly following Earth formation. Collisions with planetary embryos caused substantial melting of the growing Earth, leading to prolonged core formation, atmosphere outgassing, and deepening of the magma ocean as Earth grew. Mantle noble gas isotopic compositions and the mantle abundance of elements that partition into the core record this very early Earth differentiation. In contrast, the elements that are not involved in either core or atmosphere formation show surprisingly muted evidence of the fractionation expected during magma ocean crystallization, and even this minimal evidence for early intramantle differentiation appears to have been erased by mantle convection within ∼1.5 billion years of Earth formation. By 4.36 Ga, Earth's surface and shallow interior had reached temperatures similar to those of the present Earth, and mantle melting, and perhaps plate subduction, was producing crustal rock types similar to those see...},

abstract = {The lunar surface features diverse impact structures originating from its early bombardment; the largest among them are the lunar basins. Basin-forming impacts delivered large amounts of energy to the target and expelled lots of material that deposited as an insulating blanket in the vicinity of the impact. Here, we investigate how such processes may have altered the lunar evolution. We combine lunar basin chronologies with numerical models of basin formation and 3D thermochemical mantle convection and analyse the role of single generic impacts resulting in basins with varying diameter, formation time, location and ejecta properties. The direct effects of a single impact are enhanced melt generation as well as thermal and heat flux anomalies, but these are limited to ∼ 100 Myr following the impact. We use these insights in multi-impact scenarios more relevant for the Moon, which lead to a widespread ejecta blanket and make impact-induced effects more substantial. Lunar contraction history may be altered by the impact bombardment in favour of an early expansion phase as suggested by recent observations. Moreover, imprints of the early bombardment may be kept in the thermal and compositional state of the Moon's interior until modern times. These can be as large as those induced by uncertainties in bulk lunar heat content, if surface insulation due to ejecta is efficient. In this case, model-predicted present-day thermal profiles match independent constraints better if the bulk Moon is not significantly enriched in refractory elements compared to Earth.},

However, the timing of the formation and migration of giant planets in our solar system remains largely unconstrained. Simulating planetary accretion, we find that giant planet migration produces a relatively short-lived spike in impact velocities lasting {\~{}}0.5 My. These high-impact velocities are required to vaporize a significant fraction of Fe,Ni metal and silicates and produce the CB (Bencubbin-like) metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites, a unique class of meteorites that were created in an impact vapor-melt plume {\~{}}5 My after the first solar system solids. This indicates that the region where the CB chondrites formed was dynamically excited at this early time by the direct interference of the giant planets.

abstract = {Several episodes of complete melting have probably occurred during the first stages of the Earth's evolution. We have developed a numerical model to monitor the thermal and melt fraction evolutions of a cooling and crystallizing magma ocean from an initially fully molten mantle. For this purpose, we numerically solve the heat equation in 1D spherical geometry, accounting for turbulent heat transfer, and integrating recent and strong experimental constraints from mineral physics. We have explored different initial magma ocean viscosities, compositions, thermal boundary layer thicknesses and initial core temperatures. We show that the cooling of a thick terrestrial magma ocean is a fast process, with the entire mantle becoming significantly more viscous within 20 kyr. Due to the slope difference between the adiabats and the melting curves, the solidification of the molten mantle occurs from the bottom up. In the meantime, a crust forms due to the high surface radiative heat flow, the last drop of fully molten silicate is restricted to the upper mantle. Among the studied parameters, the magma ocean lifetime is primarily governed by its viscosity. Depending on the thermal boundary layer thickness at the core–mantle boundary, the thermal coupling between the core and magma ocean can either insulate the core during the magma ocean solidification and favor a hot core or drain the heat out of the core simultaneously with the cooling of the magma ocean. Reasonable thickness for the thermal boundary layer, however, suggests rapid core cooling until the core–mantle boundary temperature results in a sluggish lowermost mantle. Once the crystallization of the lowermost mantle becomes significant, the efficiency of the core heat loss decreases. Since a hotter liquidus favors crystallization at hotter temperatures, a hotter deep mantle liquidus favors heat retention within the core. In the context of an initially fully molten mantle, it is difficult to envision the formation of a basal magma ocean or to prevent a major heat depletion of the core. As a consequence, an Earth's geodynamo sustained only by core cooling during 4 Gyr seems unlikely and other sources of motion need to be invoked.},

@article{Laurenz2016,
abstract = {The highly siderophile elements (HSEs) are widely used as geochemical tracers for Earth's accretion and core formation history. It is generally considered that core formation strongly depleted the Earth's mantle in HSEs, which were subsequently replenished by a chondritic late veneer. However, open questions remain regarding the origin of suprachondritic Ru/Ir and Pd/Ir ratios that are thought to be characteristic for the primitive upper mantle. In most core-formation models that address the behavior of the HSEs, light elements such as S entering the core have not been taken into account and high P–T experimental data for S-bearing compositions are scarce. Here we present a comprehensive experimental study to investigate the effect of increasing S concentration in the metal on HSE metal–silicate partitioning at 2473K and 11GPa. We show that the HSEs become less siderophile with increasing S concentrations in the metal, rendering core-forming metal less efficient in removing the HSEs from the mantle if S is present. Furthermore, we investigated the FeS sulfide–silicate partitioning of the HSEs as a function of pressure (7–21GPa) and temperature (2373–2673K). The sulfide–silicate partition coefficient for Pt increases strongly with P, whereas those for Pd, Ru and Ir all decrease. The combined effect is such that above ∼20GPa Ru becomes less chalcophile than Pt, which is opposite to their behavior in the metal–silicate system where Ru is always more siderophile than Pt. The newly determined experimental results are used in a simple 2-stage core formation model that takes into account the effect of S on the behavior of the HSEs during core formation. Results of this model show that segregation of a sulfide liquid to the core from a mantle with substantial HSE concentrations plays a key role in reproducing Earth's mantle HSE abundances. As Ru and Pd are less chalcophile than Pt and Ir at high P–T, some Ru and Pd remain in the mantle after sulfide segregation. Addition of the late veneer then raised the concentrations of all HSE to their current levels. Suprachondritic Ru/Ir and Pd/Ir ratios of the mantle can thus be explained by a combination of sulfide segregation together with the addition of a late veneer without the need to invoke unknown chondritic material.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent measurements of the volatile composition of the coma of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P) allow constraints to be set on the origin of volatile elements (water, carbon, nitrogen, noble gases) in inner planets' atmospheres. Analyses by the {\{}ROSINA{\}} mass spectrometry system onboard the Rosetta spacecraft indicate that 67P ice has a D/H ratio three times that of the ocean value (Altwegg et al., 2015) and contains significant amounts of N2, CO, CO2, and importantly, argon (Balsiger et al., 2015). Here we establish a model of cometary composition based on literature data and the {\{}ROSINA{\}} measurements. From mass balance calculations, and provided that 67P is representative of the cometary ice reservoir, we conclude that the contribution of cometary volatiles to the Earth's inventory was minor for water (≤1{\%}), carbon (≤1{\%}), and nitrogen species (a few {\%} at most). However, cometary contributions to the terrestrial atmosphere may have been significant for the noble gases. They could have taken place towards the end of the main building stages of the Earth, after the Moon-forming impact and during either a late veneer episode or, more probably, the Terrestrial Late Heavy Bombardment around 4.0–3.8 billion years (Ga) ago. Contributions from the outer solar system via cometary bodies could account for the dichotomy of the noble gas isotope compositions, in particular xenon, between the mantle and the atmosphere. A mass balance based on 36Ar and organics suggests that the amount of prebiotic material delivered by comets could have been quite considerable – equivalent to the present-day mass of the biosphere. On Mars, several of the isotopic signatures of surface volatiles (notably the high D/H ratios) are clearly indicative of atmospheric escape processes. Nevertheless, we suggest that cometary contributions after the major atmospheric escape events, e.g., during a Martian Late Heavy Bombardment towards the end of the Noachian era, could account for the Martian elemental C/N/36Ar ratios, solar-like krypton isotope composition and high 15N/14N ratios. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the volatiles of Earth and Mars being trapped initially from the nebular gas and local accreting material, then progressively added to by contributions from wet bodies from increasing heliocentric distances. Overall, no unified scenario can account for all of the characteristics of the inner planet atmospheres. Advances in this domain will require precise analysis of the elemental and isotopic compositions of comets and therefore await a cometary sample return mission.},

abstract = {The mantle comprises nearly three-quarters of Earth/'s volume and through convection connects the deep interior with the lithosphere and atmosphere. The composition of the mantle determines volcanic emissions, which are intimately linked to evolution of the primitive atmosphere. Fundamental questions remain on how and when the proto-Earth mantle became oxidized, and whether redox state is homogeneous or developed large-scale structures. Here we present experiments in which we subjected two synthetic samples of nearly identical composition that are representative of the lower mantle (enstatite chondrite), but synthesized under different oxygen fugacities, to pressures and temperatures up to 90[thinsp]GPa and 2,400[thinsp]K. In addition to the mineral bridgmanite, compression of the more reduced material also produced Al2O3 as a separate phase, and the resulting assemblage is about 1 to 1.5{\%} denser than in experiments with the more oxidized material. Our geodynamic simulations suggest that such a density difference can cause a rapid ascent and accumulation of oxidized material in the upper mantle, with descent of the denser reduced material to the core-mantle boundary. We suggest that the resulting heterogeneous redox conditions in Earth/'s interior can contribute to the large low-shear velocity provinces in the lower mantle and the evolution of atmospheric oxygen.},

abstract = {Seismic images of Earth's interior reveal two massive anomalous zones at the base of the mantle, above the core, where seismic waves travel slowly. The mantle materials that surround these anomalous regions are thought to be composed of cooler rocks associated with downward advection of former oceanic tectonic plates. However, the origin and composition of the anomalous provinces is uncertain. These zones have long been depicted as warmer-than-average mantle materials related to convective upwelling. Yet, they may also be chemically distinct from the surrounding mantle, and potentially partly composed of subducted or primordial material, and have therefore been termed thermochemical piles. From seismic, geochemical and mineral physics data, the emerging view is that these thermochemical piles appear denser than the surrounding mantle materials, are dynamically stable and long-lived, and are shaped by larger-scale mantle flow. Whether remnants of a primordial layer or later accumulations of more-dense materials, the composition of the piles is modified over time by stirring and by chemical reactions with material from the surrounding mantle, underlying core and potentially from volatile elements transported into the deep Earth by subducted plates. Upwelling mantle plumes may originate from the thermochemical piles, so the unusual chemical composition of the piles could be the source of distinct trace-element signatures observed in hotspot lavas.},

abstract = {Abstract The abundance of moderately siderophile elements (“iron-loving”; e.g. Co, Ni) in the Earth's mantle is 10 to 100 times larger than predicted by chemical equilibrium between silicate melt and iron at low pressure, but it does match expectation for equilibrium at high pressure and temperature. Recent studies of differentiated planetesimal impacts assume that planetesimal cores survive the impact intact as concentrated masses that passively settle from a zero initial velocity and undergo turbulent entrainment in a global magma ocean; under these conditions, cores greater than 10 km in diameter do not fully mix without a sufficiently deep magma ocean. We have performed hydrocode simulations that revise this assumption and yield a clearer picture of the impact process for differentiated planetesimals possessing iron cores with radius = 100 km that impact into magma oceans. The impact process strips away the silicate mantle of the planetesimal and then stretches the iron core, dispersing the liquid iron into a much larger volume of the underlying liquid silicate mantle. Lagrangian tracer particles track the initially intact iron core as the impact stretches and disperses the core. The final displacement distance of initially closest tracer pairs gives a metric of core stretching. The statistics of stretching imply mixing that separates the iron core into sheets, ligaments, and smaller fragments, on a scale of 10 km or less. The impact dispersed core fragments undergo further mixing through turbulent entrainment as the molten iron fragments rain through the magma ocean and settle deeper into the planet. Our results thus support the idea that iron in the cores of even large differentiated planetesimals can chemically equilibrate deep in a terrestrial magma ocean.},

@article{Walker2009,
abstract = {The highly siderophile elements (HSE) pose a challenge for planetary geochemistry. They are normally strongly partitioned into metal relative to silicate. Consequently, planetary core segregation might be expected to essentially quantitatively remove these elements from planetary mantles. Yet the abundances of these elements estimated for Earth's primitive upper mantle (PUM) and the martian mantle are broadly similar, and only about 200 times lower than those of chondritic meteorites. In contrast, although problematic to estimate, abundances in the lunar mantle may be more than twenty times lower than in the terrestrial PUM. The generally chondritic Os isotopic compositions estimated for the terrestrial, lunar and martian mantles require that their long-term Re/Os ratios were within the range of chondritic meteorites. Further, most HSE in the terrestrial PUM also appear to be present in chondritic relative abundances, although Ru/Ir and Pd/Ir ratios are slightly suprachondritic. Similarly suprachondritic Ru/Ir and Pd/Ir ratios have also been reported for some lunar impact melt breccias that were created via large basin forming events. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to account for the HSE present in Earth's mantle. These hypotheses include inefficient core formation, lowered metal-silicate D values resulting from metal segregation at elevated temperatures and pressures (as may occur at the base of a deep magma ocean), and late accretion of materials with chondritic bulk compositions after the cessation of core segregation. Synthesis of the large database now available for HSE in the terrestrial mantle, lunar samples, and martian meteorites reveals that each of the main hypotheses has flaws. Most difficult to explain is the similarity between HSE in the Earth's PUM and estimates for the martian mantle, coupled with the striking differences between the PUM and estimates for the lunar mantle. More complex, hybrid models that may include aspects of inefficient core formation, HSE partitioning at elevated temperatures and pressures, and late accretion may ultimately be necessary to account for all of the observed HSE characteristics. Participation of aspects of each process may not be surprising as it is difficult to envision the growth of a planet, like Earth, without the involvement of each.},

abstract = {We address the thermal history of the Earth after the Moon-forming impact, taking tidal heating and thermal blanketing by the atmosphere into account. The atmosphere sets an upper bound of ∼100 W/m2 on how quickly the Earth can cool. The liquid magma ocean cools over 2–10 Myr, with longer times corresponding to high angular-momentum events. Tidal heating is focused mostly in mantle materials that are just beginning to freeze. The atmosphere's control over cooling sets up a negative feedback between viscosity-dependent tidal heating and temperature-dependent viscosity of the magma ocean. While the feedback holds, evolution of the Moon's orbit is limited by the modest radiative cooling rate of Earth's atmosphere. Orbital evolution is orders of magnitude slower than in conventional constant Q models, which promotes capture by resonances. The evection resonance is encountered early, when the Earth is molten. Capture by the evection resonance appears certain but unlikely to generate much eccentricity because it is encountered early when the Earth is molten and Q⊕≫Q☾. Tidal dissipation in the Earth becomes more efficient (Q⊕≪Q☾) later when the Moon is between ∼20R⊕ and ∼40R⊕. If lunar eccentricity grew great, this was when it did so, perhaps setting the table for some other process to leave its mark on the inclination of the Moon.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope abundances provide a powerful tool for recognizing genetic relationships among meteorites. Among the differentiated achondrites, three isotopic groups are recognized: (l ) SNC (Mars), (2) Earth and Moon, and (3) HED (howardites, eucrites, diogenites). The HED group also contains the mesosiderites, main-group pallasites, and silicates from IIIAB irons. The angrites may be marginally resolvable from the HED group. Within each of these groups, internal geologic processes give rise to isotopic variations along a slope-12 fractionation line, as is well known for terrestrial materials. Variations of $\Delta$17O from one planet to another are inherited from the inhomogeneities in the solar nebula, as illustrated by the isotopic compositions of chondrites and their constituents. Among the undifferentiated achondrites, five isotopic groups are found: (1) aubrites, (2) winonaites and IAB-IIICD irons, (3) brachinites, (4) acapulcoites and lodranites, and (5) ureilites. The isotopic compositions of aubrites coincide with the Earth and Moon, and also with the enstatite chondrites. These bodies apparently were derived from a. common reservoir, the isotopic composition of which was established at the chondrule scale by nebular processes. Isotopic similarities between chondrites and achondrites are seen only for the following instances: (1) enstatite chondrites and aubrites, (2) H chondrites and HE irons, and (3) L or LL chondrites and IVA irons. The isotopic data also support the following genetic associations: (1) winonaites and IAB-IIICD irons, (2) acapulcoites and lodranites, and (3) ureilites and dark inclusions of C3 chondrites. An attempt to reconcile the whole-planet isotopic compositions of Earth, Mars, and the eucrite parent body with mixing models of their chemical compositions failed. It is not possible to satisfy both the chemical and isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets using known primitive Solar System components.},

abstract = {The apparent overabundance of the highly siderophile elements (HSEs: Pt-group elements, Re and Au) in the mantles of Earth, Moon and Mars has not been satisfactorily explained. Although late accretion of a chondritic component seems to provide the most plausible explanation, metal–silicate equilibration in a magma ocean cannot be ruled out due to a lack of HSE partitioning data suitable for extrapolations to the relevant high pressure and high temperature conditions. We provide a new data set of partition coefficients simultaneously determined for Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Ir and Pt over a range of 3.5–18GPa and 2423–2773K. In multianvil experiments, molten peridotite was equilibrated in MgO single crystal capsules with liquid Fe-alloy that contained bulk HSE concentrations of 53.2–98.9 wt{\%} (XFe=0.03–0.67) such that oxygen fugacities of IW−1.5 to IW+1.6 (i.e. logarithmic units relative to the iron-w{\"{u}}stite buffer) were established at run conditions. To analyse trace concentrations of the HSEs in the silicate melt with LA-ICP-MS, two silicate glass standards (1–119ppm Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Ir, Pt) were produced and evaluated for this study. Using an asymmetric regular solution model we have corrected experimental partition coefficients to account for the differences between HSE metal activities in the multicomponent Fe-alloys and infinite dilution. Based on the experimental data, the P and T dependence of the partition coefficients (D) was parameterized. The partition coefficients of all HSEs studied decrease with increasing pressure and to a greater extent with increasing temperature. Except for Pt, the decrease with pressure is stronger below ∼6GPa and much weaker in the range 6–18GPa. This change might result from pressure induced coordination changes in the silicate liquid. Extrapolating the D values over a large range of potential P–T conditions in a terrestrial magma ocean (peridotite liquidus at P⩽60–80GPa) we conclude that the P–T-induced decrease of D would not have been sufficient to explain HSE mantle abundances by metal–silicate equilibration at a common set of P–T-oxygen fugacity conditions. Therefore, the mantle concentrations of most HSEs cannot have been established during core formation. The comparatively less siderophile Pd might have been partly retained in the magma ocean if effective equilibration pressures reached 35–50GPa. To a much smaller extent this could also apply to Pt and Rh providing that equilibration pressures reached ⩾60GPa in the late stage of accretion. With most of the HSE partition coefficients at 60GPa still differing by 0.5–3 orders of magnitude, metal–silicate equilibration alone cannot have produced the observed near-chondritic HSE abundances of the mantles of the Earth as well as of the Moon or Mars. Our results show that an additional process, such as the accretion of a late veneer composed of some type of chondritic material, was required. The results, therefore, support recent hybrid models, which propose that the observed HSE signatures are a combined result of both metal–silicate partitioning as well as an overprint by late accretion.},

abstract = {Experimental studies of the partitioning of siderophile elements between metallic and silicate liquids have provided fundamental constraints on the early history and differentiation conditions of the Earth. With many new studies even in the last 20yr, several models have emerged from the results, including low pressure equilibrium, high pressure equilibrium, and combined high and low pressure multi-stage models. The reasons – silicate melt composition, pressure effects on silicate melt structure, different methods for calculating metal activity coefficients, and the role of deep mantle phases – for the multitude of resulting models have not been specifically addressed before, yet are critical in evaluating the more likely and realistic models. The four reasons leading to the divergence of results will be discussed and evaluated. The behavior of the moderately siderophile elements Ni and Co will be compared using several approaches, each of which results in the same conclusion for Ni and Co. This consistency will eliminate the supposition that one or the other approaches gives a more accurate answer for element partitioning. Newly updated expressions for 11 elements are then derived and presented and applied to the early Earth to evaluate the idea of a late stage equilibration between a core forming metal and silicate melt (or magma ocean). It is possible to explain all 11 elements at conditions of 27–33GPa, 3300–3600K, $\Delta$IW=−1, for peridotite and a metallic liquid containing 10{\%} of a light element. The main difference between the current result and several other recent modeling efforts is that Mn, V, and Cr are hosted in deep mantle phases as well as the core. The other elements – Ni, Co, Mo, W, P, Cu, Ga, and Pd – are hosted in core, and detailed modeling here shows the importance of accounting for oxygen fugacity, silicate and metallic liquid compositions, as well as temperature and pressure. The idea of late stage metal–silicate equilibrium at a restricted pressure and temperature range leaving a chemical finger print on the upper mantle remains viable.},

abstract = {We have combined metal–silicate partitioning data from the literature with new experimental results at 1.5–8GPa and 1480–2000°C to parameterize the effects of pressure, temperature and composition on the partitioning of V, Cr and Nb between liquid Fe metal (with low S and C content) and silicate melt. Using information from the steelmaking literature to correct for interactions in the metal phase, we find that, for peridotitic silicate melts, metal–silicate partition coefficients are given by:logDNbmet/sil=2.5logDFemet/sil+1.57-11,930T-114(±43)PT±0.41logDVmet/sil=1.5logDFemet/sil+0.582-6493T-62(±19)PT±0.08logDCrmet/sil=logDFemet/sil+0.643-4232(±538)T-22(±13)PTwhere Dimet/sil is the partition coefficient for element i. Partitioning of V and Cr is insensitive to silicate melt composition, but Nb shows a considerable compositional effect. The new data enable us to examine different models of terrestrial accretion and core formation. If we fix the Fe content of the mantle at the current value and use the Ni content of the mantle to estimate pressure of equilibration then temperatures about 1200°C above the silicate liquidus are required to match vanadium partitioning to the current concentration of V in the mantle. Under these conditions the core concentrations of Si (∼15{\%}) and Nb ({\textgreater}60{\%} of Earth's budget) are implausibly high. A more realistic approach is to assume that the metal of accreting planetesimals equilibrated at the base of a deep magma ocean whose temperature was close to the silicate liquidus. As the magma ocean deepened in proportion to the size of the Earth the metal was continuously extracted to the core without further re-equilibration in the lowermost mantle. In this case the V, Cr and Nb contents of core and mantle can easily reproduce the expected values provided the Earth became more oxidized as it accreted (O'Neill H. S. (1991) The origin of the Moon and the early history of the Earth—a chemical model. 2. The Earth Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 55(4), 1159–1172; Wade J. and Wood B. J.

(1988) Chemical-composition and accretion history of terrestrial planets. Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond. A-Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 325(1587), 545–557). Increasing oxidation requires the oxidized Fe content of the mantle to increase from 0.5{\%} to 1.0{\%} to the current value of 6.26{\%} as the Earth grew. This model , with magma ocean thickness corresponding to 35{\%} of mantle depth, reproduces the calculated core–mantle partitioning of Ni, and Co and yields a Si content of the core of approximately 6{\%}, in good agreement with cosmochemical estimates.},

abstract = {We performed experiments to separate the effects of temperature, pressure and metal composition on the metal-silicate partitioning of V, Ni, Co, Mn and Si in order to refine the ‘deep magma ocean' model of core formation. Interactions in the liquid metal were accounted for by using a well-known metallurgical model combined with data from the literature. Temperature effects were calculated using free energy data for liquid metals and liquid oxides. This approach enabled us to separate pressure effects from those of the other two variables. If we assume that the core formed by a single-stage process then we find that the mantle concentrations of the refractory elements can be matched at a temperature of 3750 K and a pressure of 40 GPa. These values are in good agreement with recent estimates based on other partitioning data. The calculated temperature is, however, 700 °C above the peridotite liquidus at 40 GPa, and is therefore physically implausible. The base of the magma ocean, at which metal would pond during accretion must be saturated in crystals and should, therefore lie at or below the silicate liquidus. We find that dynamic accretion models, in which pressure increased as the earth grew, do not improve the match to the peridotite liquidus so long as the oxygen fugacity is fixed by the current Fe content of the mantle. If, however, we force temperature to lie on the peridotite liquidus as the earth grew, the mantle concentrations of refractory elements can be matched provided oxygen fugacity increased during accretion. To illustrate this we use accretionary models in which, as the earth grew, the base of the magma ocean was at half the mantle depth and applied gradual or step-changes in oxygen fugacity. If we apply a 2 log unit increase in oxygen fugacity, the siderophile element contents of the mantle are matched, the Si content of the core is 5 to 7 wt.{\%} and the average core segregation temperature is 2990 K, within the experimental range. Oxidation during accretion is an important component of heterogeneous accretion models, but the mechanisms proposed are generally untestable. Here we propose that an increase in oxidation state is a natural consequence of the size of the earth. Magnesium silicate perovskite is the principal phase in the earth's lower mantle. This phase forces the disproportionation of ferrous iron into ferric iron plus metal. When perovskite started to grow at the base of the magma ocean, dissolution and reprecipitation acted as an ‘oxygen pump' injecting oxidized ferric iron into the upper mantle. As the earth continued to grow, infalling metal was oxidized by the ferric iron into ferrous iron, raising the iron content of the magma ocean and the oxygen fugacity of metal-silicate equilibration. This process did not occur to any great extent on Mars because of the limited stability of perovskite in the smaller planet},

On the basis of partitioning experiments at high pressure (35 to 74 gigapascals) and high temperature (3100 to 4400 kelvin), we demonstrate that depletions of slightly siderophile elements (vanadium and chromium), as well as moderately siderophile elements (nickel and cobalt), can be produced by core formation under more oxidizing conditions than previously proposed. Enhanced solubility of oxygen in the metal perturbs the metal-silicate partitioning of vanadium and chromium, precluding extrapolation of previous results. We propose that Earth accreted from materials as oxidized as ordinary or carbonaceous chondrites. Transfer of oxygen from the mantle to the core provides a mechanism to reduce the initial magma ocean redox state to that of the present-day mantle, reconciling the observed mantle vanadium and chromium concentrations with geophysical constraints on light elements in the core.},

abstract = {The pattern of siderophile (iron-loving) element abundance in the silicate portion of the Earth is a consequence of metal separation during core formation. The apparent excess of nickel and cobalt in mantle-derived rocks has been attributed to metal-silicate equilibration in a deep terrestrial magma ocean. Based on the extrapolation of phase equilibria and metal-silicate partitioning results obtained at lower pressure (P) and temperature (T), previous estimates of the P–T of equilibration are all greater than 25GPa and 3000K. Using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell, we have extended metal–silicate partitioning measurements for Ni and Co to 75GPa and 4400K, exceeding the liquidus temperatures for both metal and silicate (basalt or peridotite) and, therefore, achieving thermodynamic conditions directly comparable to those of the magma ocean. The metal–silicate partition coefficients of nickel and cobalt decrease with increasing pressure and reach the values required to yield present mantle concentrations at {\~{}}50GPa. At these conditions, silicon and oxygen concentrations measured in the metallic liquid allow to solve the seismically constrained core density deficit. Above 60GPa, the partition coefficients become too low, resulting in an overabundance of Ni and Co in the silicate mantle. Our data therefore support the paradigm of core formation in a deep mama ocean, providing an upper bound for the depth at which Earth's core may have formed, and explaining the main geophysical (density) and geochemical (excess siderophile elements) observables.},

abstract = {We discuss the geophysical implications of recent first principles molecular dynamics simulations of MgSiO3 liquid, in particular the findings that the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter increases by a factor of three on two-fold compression, and the predicted melting curve. The predicted melting temperature of MgSiO3 perovskite at 136 GPa is 5400±600 K, which if lowered by freezing point depression by 1300 K, yields a mantle solidus temperature of 4100 K, identical to recent estimates of the temperature at the base of the mantle. We argue on this basis that partial melting at the base of the mantle is plausible. While MgSiO3 perovskite is denser than the isochemical liquid, reasonable values of iron partitioning and bulk iron contents, leads to the conclusion that a melt at the base of the multi-component mantle would be denser than its surroundings and therefore buoyantly stable. We predict the bulk sound velocity of this melt to be 10.9 km s−1, less than that of ultra-low velocity zones, and consistent with the explanation of these regions as being due to partial melting. The increase on compression of the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter in the liquid state yields isentropes that are much hotter than previously thought: a potential temperature of only 2450 K is sufficient to melt the entire mantle, and a magma ocean will begin crystallization at mid-mantle depths, rather than at the base of the mantle.},

abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log 10 R s = k 1 + {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/669/2/1279/img2.gif] {\{}img2.gif{\}} log 10 ( M s ) - k 2 M {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/669/2/1279/img4.gif] {\{}img4.gif{\}} for up to M p ≈ 20 M ⊕ , where M s and R s are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form $\rho$ = $\rho$ 0 + cP n . We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5{\%} fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with {\~{}}5{\%} uncertainty water ice planets with {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {\{}gtrsim{\}} 25{\%} water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of "super-Earths" based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},

abstract = {Interrogating physical processes that occur within the lowermost mantle is a key to understanding Earth's evolution and present-day inner composition. Among such processes, partial melting has been proposed to explain mantle regions with ultralow seismic velocities near the core-mantle boundary, but experimental validation at the appropriate temperature and pressure regimes remains challenging. Using laser-heated diamond anvil cells, we constructed the solidus curve of a natural fertile peridotite between 36 and 140 gigapascals. Melting at core-mantle boundary pressures occurs at 4180 ± 150 kelvin, which is a value that matches estimated mantle geotherms. Molten regions may therefore exist at the base of the present-day mantle. Melting phase relations and element partitioning data also show that these liquids could host many incompatible elements at the base of the mantle.},

These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below {\$}T{\_}{\{}eff{\}} \backslashsim 3700K{\$}, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude.

abstract = {It is generally accepted that silicate-metal (‘rocky') planet formation relies on coagulation from a mixture of sub-Mars sized planetary embryos and (smaller) planetesimals that dynamically emerge from the evolving circum-solar disc in the first few million years of our Solar System. Once the planets have, for the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be bombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion. Here we place limits on the mass and evolution of these planetesimals based on constraints from the highly siderophile element (HSE) budget of the Moon. Outcomes from a combination of N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of planet formation lead us to four key conclusions about the nature of this early epoch. First, matching the terrestrial to lunar HSE ratio requires either that the late veneer on Earth consisted of a single lunar-size impactor striking the Earth before 4.45 Ga, or that it originated from the impact that created the Moon. An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the Moon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth. Second, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight percent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low (≲10−6 M⊕ Myr−1) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after 4.4 Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This conclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed previously. Last, after the terrestrial planets had fully formed, the mass in remnant planetesimals was ∼10−3 M⊕, lower by at least an order of magnitude than most previous models suggest. Our dynamically and geochemically self-consistent scenario requires that future N-body simulations of rocky planet formation either directly incorporate collisional grinding or rely on pebble accretion.},

abstract = {Several new scenarios of the Moon-forming giant impact have been proposed to reconcile the giant impact theory with the recent recognition of the volatile and refractory isotopic similarities between Moon and Earth. Two scenarios leave the post-impact Earth spinning much faster than what is inferred from the present Earth-Moon system's angular momentum. The evection resonance has been proposed to drain the excess angular momentum, but the lunar orbit stays at high orbital eccentricities for long periods in the resonance, which would cause large tidal heating in the Moon. A limit cycle related to the evection resonance has also been suggested as an alternative mechanism to reduce the angular momentum, which keeps the lunar orbit at much lower eccentricities, and operates in a wider range of parameters. In this study we use a coupled thermal-orbital model to determine the effect of the change of the Moon's thermal state on the Earth-Moon system's dynamical history. The evection resonance no longer drains angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system since the system rapidly exits the resonance. Whereas the limit cycle works robustly to drain as much angular momentum as in the non-thermally-coupled model, though the Moon's tidal properties change throughout the evolution.},

abstract = {Vigorous convection in Earth's core powers our global magnetic field, which has survived for over three billion years. In this study, we calculate the rate of entropy production available to drive the dynamo throughout geologic time using one-dimensional parameterizations of the evolution of Earth's core and mantle. To prevent a thermal catastrophe in models with realistic Urey ratios, we avoid the conventional scaling for plate tectonics in favor of one featuring reduced convective vigor for hotter mantle. We present multiple simulations that capture the effects of uncertainties in key parameters like the rheology of the lower mantle and the overall thermal budget. Simple scaling laws imply that the heat flow across the core/mantle boundary was elevated by less than a factor of two in the past relative to the present. Another process like the precipitation of magnesium-bearing minerals is therefore required to sustain convection prior to the nucleation of the inner core roughly one billion years ago, especially given the recent, upward revision to the thermal conductivity of the core. Simulations that include precipitation lack a dramatic increase in entropy production associated with the formation of the inner core, complicating attempts to determine its age using paleomagnetic measurements of field intensity. Because mantle dynamics impose strict limits on the amount of heat extracted from the core, we find that the addition of radioactive isotopes like potassium-40 implies less entropy production today and in the past. On terrestrial planets like Venus with more sluggish mantle convection, even precipitation of elements like magnesium may not sustain a dynamo if cooling rates are too slow.},

@article{Obrien2006,
abstract = {We have performed 8 numerical simulations of the final stages of accretion of the terrestrial planets, each starting with over 5× more gravitationally interacting bodies than in any previous simulations. We use a bimodal initial population spanning the region from 0.3 to 4 AU with 25 roughly Mars-mass embryos and an equal mass of material in a population of ∼1000 smaller planetesimals, consistent with models of the oligarchic growth of protoplanetary embryos. Given the large number of small planetesimals in our simulations, we are able to more accurately treat the effects of dynamical friction during the accretion process. We find that dynamical friction can significantly lower the timescales for accretion of the terrestrial planets and leads to systems of terrestrial planets that are much less dynamically excited than in previous simulations with fewer initial bodies. In addition, we study the effects of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn on the final planetary systems by running 4 of our simulations with the present, eccentric orbits of Jupiter and Saturn (the EJS simulations) and the other 4 using a nearly circular and co-planar Jupiter and Saturn as predicted in the Nice Model of the evolution of the outer Solar System [Gomes, R., Levison, H.F., Tsiganis, K., Morbidelli, A., 2005. Nature 435, 466–469; Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., 2005. Nature 435, 459–461; Morbidelli, A., Levison, H.F., Tsiganis, K., Gomes, R., 2005. Nature 435, 462–465] (the CJS simulations). Our EJS simulations provide a better match to our Solar System in terms of the number and average mass of the final planets and the mass-weighted mean semi-major axis of the final planetary systems, although increased dynamical friction can potentially improve the fit of the CJS simulations as well. However, we find that in our EJS simulations, essentially no water-bearing material from the outer asteroid belt ends up in the final terrestrial planets, while a large amount is delivered in the CJS simulations. In addition, the terrestrial planets in the EJS simulations receive a late veneer of material after the last giant impact event that is likely too massive to reconcile with the siderophile abundances in the Earth's mantle, while the late veneer in the CJS simulations is much more consistent with geochemical evidence.},

abstract = {We extend to three dimensions the Concentric Maclaurin Spheroid method for obtaining the self-consistent shape and gravitational field of a rotating liquid planet, to include a tidal potential from a satellite. We exhibit, for the first time, an important effect of the planetary rotation rate on tidal response of gas giants, whose shape is dominated by the centrifugal potential from rapid rotation. Simulations of planets with fast rotation rates like those of Jupiter and Saturn, exhibit significant changes in calculated tidal love numbers knmwhen compared with non-rotating bodies. A test model of Saturn fitted to observed zonal gravitational multipole harmonics yields k2=0.413, consistent with a recent observational determination from Cassini astrometry data (Lainey et al., 2016.). The calculated love number is robust under reasonable assumptions of interior rotation rate, satellite parameters, and details of Saturn's interior structure. The method is benchmarked against several published test cases.},

abstract = {A model of a giant impact between two planetary bodies is widely accepted to account for the Earth–Moon system. Despite the importance of this event for understanding early Earth evolution and the inventory of Earth's volatiles critical to life, the timing of the impact is poorly constrained. We explore a data-based, two-stage Pb isotope evolution model in which the timing of the loss of volatile Pb relative to refractory U in the aftermath of the giant impact is faithfully recorded in the Pb isotopes of bulk silicate Earth. Constraining the first stage Pb isotopic evolution permits calculating an age range of 4.426–4.417 Ga for the inflection in the U/Pb ratio related to the giant impact. This model is supported by Pb isotope data for angrite meteorites that we use to demonstrate volatility-driven, planetary-scale Pb loss was an efficient process during the early Solar System. The revised age is ∼100 Myr younger than most current estimates for the age of the Moon but fully consistent with recent ages for lunar ferroan anorthosite and the timing of Earth's first crust inferred from the terrestrial zircon record. The estimated loss of ∼98{\%} of terrestrial Pb relative to the Solar System bulk composition by the end of the Moon-forming process implies that the current inventory of Earth's most volatile elements, including water, arrived during post-impact veneering by volatile-rich bodies.},

abstract = {Recent measurements of the volatile composition of the coma of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P) allow constraints to be set on the origin of volatile elements (water, carbon, nitrogen, noble gases) in inner planets' atmospheres. Analyses by the ROSINA mass spectrometry system onboard the Rosetta spacecraft indicate that 67P ice has a D/H ratio three times that of the ocean value (Altwegg et al., 2015) and contains significant amounts of N2, CO, CO2, and importantly, argon (Balsiger et al., 2015). Here we establish a model of cometary composition based on literature data and the ROSINA measurements. From mass balance calculations, and provided that 67P is representative of the cometary ice reservoir, we conclude that the contribution of cometary volatiles to the Earth's inventory was minor for water (≤1{\%}), carbon (≤1{\%}), and nitrogen species (a few {\%} at most). However, cometary contributions to the terrestrial atmosphere may have been significant for the noble gases. They could have taken place towards the end of the main building stages of the Earth, after the Moon-forming impact and during either a late veneer episode or, more probably, the Terrestrial Late Heavy Bombardment around 4.0–3.8 billion years (Ga) ago. Contributions from the outer solar system via cometary bodies could account for the dichotomy of the noble gas isotope compositions, in particular xenon, between the mantle and the atmosphere. A mass balance based on 36Ar and organics suggests that the amount of prebiotic material delivered by comets could have been quite considerable – equivalent to the present-day mass of the biosphere. On Mars, several of the isotopic signatures of surface volatiles (notably the high D/H ratios) are clearly indicative of atmospheric escape processes. Nevertheless, we suggest that cometary contributions after the major atmospheric escape events, e.g., during a Martian Late Heavy Bombardment towards the end of the Noachian era, could account for the Martian elemental C/N/36Ar ratios, solar-like krypton isotope composition and high 15N/14N ratios. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the volatiles of Earth and Mars being trapped initially from the nebular gas and local accreting material, then progressively added to by contributions from wet bodies from increasing heliocentric distances. Overall, no unified scenario can account for all of the characteristics of the inner planet atmospheres. Advances in this domain will require precise analysis of the elemental and isotopic compositions of comets and therefore await a cometary sample return mission.},

@article{Driscoll2014,
abstract = {The study of the thermal evolution of Earth's interior is uncertain and controversial in many respects, from the interpretation of petrologic observations used to infer the temperature and dynamics of the interior, to the physics and material properties governing heat transport. The thermal history of Venus is even more uncertain, but the lack of a dynamo at present in an otherwise similar planet may provide additional constraints on terrestrial planet evolution. In this paper a one dimensional thermal history model is derived that includes heat loss due to mantle melt eruption at the surface to explore its influence on the thermal and magnetic history of Earth and Venus. We show that the thermal catastrophe of Earth's mantle, which occurs for a present day Urey ratio of 1/3 and convective heat loss exponent of ??=1/3, can be avoided by assuming a rather high core heat flow of {\~{}}15TW. This core heat flow also avoids the new core paradox by allowing for the geodynamo to be thermally powered prior to inner core growth for core thermal conductivities as high as 130Wm-1K-1. Dynamo regime diagrams demonstrate that the mantle melt eruption rate has a minor effect on the history of mobile lid planets due to the efficiency of plate tectonic convective heat loss. However, if Earth were in a stagnant lid regime prior to 2.5Ga, as has been proposed, then at least {\~{}}5{\%} of mantle melt is required to erupt in order to thermally power the paleodynamo at that time. Dynamo regime diagrams for stagnant lid Venus models indicate that more than half of the melt generated in the mantle is required to erupt in order to overcome the insulation imposed by the stagnant lid and drive a dynamo. This implies that with an Earth-like mantle radioactivity the Venusian dynamo shut down {\~{}}0.3Ga for an eruption efficiency of 50{\%}, and {\~{}}3Ga for an eruption efficiency of zero. Consequently, a stagnant lid alone does not prevent a core dynamo if melting of the upper mantle provides a substantial mantle heat sink.},

abstract = {The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), a hypothesized impact spike at ∼3.9 Ga, is one of the major scientific concepts to emerge from Apollo-era lunar exploration. A significant portion of the evidence for the existence of the LHB comes from histograms of (40)Ar/(39)Ar "plateau" ages (i.e., regions selected on the basis of apparent isochroneity). However, due to lunar magmatism and overprinting from subsequent impact events, virtually all Apollo-era samples show evidence for (40)Ar/(39)Ar age spectrum disturbances, leaving open the possibility that partial (40)Ar* resetting could bias interpretation of bombardment histories due to plateaus yielding misleadingly young ages. We examine this possibility through a physical model of (40)Ar* diffusion in Apollo samples and test the uniqueness of the impact histories obtained by inverting plateau age histograms. Our results show that plateau histograms tend to yield age peaks, even in those cases where the input impact curve did not contain such a spike, in part due to the episodic nature of lunar crust or parent body formation. Restated, monotonically declining impact histories yield apparent age peaks that could be misinterpreted as LHB-type events. We further conclude that the assignment of apparent (40)Ar/(39)Ar plateau ages bears an undesirably high degree of subjectivity. When compounded by inappropriate interpretations of histograms constructed from plateau ages, interpretation of apparent, but illusory, impact spikes is likely.},

abstract = {We present numerical experiments investigating the shape and spin limits of self-gravitating "perfect" rubble piles that consist of identical, smooth, rigid, spherical particles with configurable normal coefficient of restitution and no sliding friction. Such constructs are currently employed in a variety of investigations, ranging from the formation of asteroid satellites to the dynamical properties of Saturn's densest rings. We find that, owing to cannonball stacking behavior, rubble piles can maintain non-spherical shapes without bulk spin, unlike a fluid, and can spin faster than a perfect fluid before shedding mass, consistent with the theory for the more general continuum rubble pile model (Holsapple, 2004, Icarus 172, 272-303). Rubble piles that reassemble following a catastrophic disruption reconfigure themselves to lie within stability limits predicted by the continuum theory. We also find that coarse configurations consisting of a small number of particles are more resistant to tidal disruption than fine configurations with many particles. Overall this study shows that idealized rubble piles behave qualitatively in a manner similar to certain granular materials, at least in the limit where global shape readjustments and/or mass shedding begins. The limits obtained here may provide constraints on the possible internal structure of some small Solar System bodies that have extreme shapes or are under high stress. Amalthea is presented as a case study. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Holsapple [Holsapple, K.A., 2001. Icarus 154, 432–448; Holsapple, K.A., 2004. Icarus 172, 272–303] determined the spin limits of bodies using a model for solid bodies without tensile or cohesive strength, but with the pressure-induced shear strengths characteristic of dry sands and gravels. That theory included the classical analyses for fluid bodies given by Maclaurin, Jacobi and others as a special case. For the general solid bodies, it was shown that there exists a very wide range of permissible shapes and spin limits; and explicit algebraic results for those limits were given. This paper gives an extension of those analyses to include geological-like materials that also have tensile and cohesive strength. Those strengths are necessary to explain the smaller, fast-rotating asteroids discovered in the last few years. I find that the spin limits for these more general solids have two limiting regimes: a strength regime for bodies with a diameter {\textless}3 km, and a gravity regime for the larger bodies with a diameter {\textgreater}10 km (which is the case covered by the earlier papers). I derive explicit algebraic forms for the dependence of the spin limits on shape, mass density and material strength properties. The comparison of the theory to the database for the spins of asteroids and trans-neptunian objects (TNO's) objects shows excellent agreement. For large bodies (diameter D{\textgreater}10 km), the presence of cohesive and/or tensile strength does not permit higher spin rates than would be allowed for rubble pile bodies. Thus, the fact that the spin rates of all large bodies is limited to periods greater than about 2 h does not imply that they are rubble piles. In contrast, for small bodies (D{\textless}10 km) the presence of even a very small amount of strength allows much more rapid spins. Small bodies might then be rubble piles but require a small amount of bonding. Finally, I make some remarks about the application of the theory to the TNO's and large asteroids, and question whether a common assumption by researchers that those bodies must take on relaxed fluid shapes is warranted. If not, then the densities and shapes required by that assumption are not valid. I use 2003 EL61 as a prime example.},

abstract = {Satellites of asteroids have been discovered in nearly every known small body population, and a remarkable aspect of the known satellites is the diversity of their properties. They tell a story of vast differences in formation and evolution mechanisms that act as a function of size, distance from the Sun, and the properties of their nebular environment at the beginning of Solar System history and their dynamical environment over the next 4.5 Gyr. The mere existence of these systems provides a laboratory to study numerous types of physical processes acting on asteroids and their dynamics provide a valuable probe of their physical properties otherwise possible only with spacecraft. Advances in understanding the formation and evolution of binary systems have been assisted by: 1) the growing catalog of known systems, increasing from 33 to nearly 250 between the Merline et al. (2002) Asteroids III chapter and now, 2) the detailed study and long-term monitoring of individual systems such as 1999 KW4 and 1996 FG3, 3) the discovery of new binary system morphologies and triple systems, 4) and the discovery of unbound systems that appear to be end-states of binary dynamical evolutionary paths. Specifically for small bodies (diameter smaller than 10 km), these observations and discoveries have motivated theoretical work finding that thermal forces can efficiently drive the rotational disruption of small asteroids. Long-term monitoring has allowed studies to constrain the system's dynamical evolution by the combination of tides, thermal forces and rigid body physics. The outliers and split pairs have pushed the theoretical work to explore a wide range of evolutionary end-states.},

abstract = {We reconsider the commonly held assumption that warm debris disks are tracers of terrestrial planet formation. The high occurrence rate inferred for Earth-mass planets around mature solar-type stars based on exoplanet surveys (roughly 20{\%}) stands in stark contrast to the low incidence rate (less than 2-3{\%}) of warm dusty debris around solar-type stars during the expected epoch of terrestrial planet assembly (roughly 10 Myr). If Earth-mass planets at AU distances are a common outcome of the planet formation process, this discrepancy suggests that rocky planet formation occurs more quickly and/or is much neater than traditionally believed, leaving behind little in the way of a dust signature. Alternatively, the incidence rate of terrestrial planets has been overestimated or some previously unrecognized physical mechanism removes warm dust efficiently from the terrestrial planet region. A promising removal mechanism is gas drag in a residual gaseous disk with a surface density of roughly or somewhat more than 0.001{\%} of the minimum mass solar nebula.},

abstract = {The atmospheric compositions of Venus and Earth differ significantly, with the venusian atmosphere containing about 50 times as much 36Ar as the atmosphere on Earth. The different effects of the solar wind on planet-forming materials for Earth and Venus have been proposed to account for some of this difference in atmospheric composition, but the cause of the compositional difference has not yet been fully resolved. Here we propose that the absence or presence of an ocean at the surface of a protoplanet during the giant impact phase could have determined its subsequent atmospheric amount and composition. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of an ocean significantly enhances the loss of atmosphere during a giant impact owing to two effects: evaporation of the ocean, and lower shock impedance of the ocean compared to the ground. Protoplanets near Earth's orbit are expected to have had oceans, whereas those near Venus' orbit are not, and we therefore suggest that remnants of the noble-gas rich proto-atmosphere survived on Venus, but not on Earth. Our proposed mechanism explains differences in the atmospheric contents of argon, krypton and xenon on Venus and Earth, but most of the neon must have escaped from both planets' atmospheres later to yield the observed ratio of neon to argon.},

abstract = {When a giant impact occurs, atmosphere loss may occur due to global ground motion excited by a strong shock wave traveling in the planetary interior. Here, the relations between the ground motion and the amount of the lost atmosphere are systematically investigated through calculations of a spherically one-dimensional atmospheric motion for various initial atmospheric conditions. The fraction of the lost atmosphere to the total mass of the atmosphere is found to be controlled only by the ground velocity and, insensitive to the initial atmospheric conditions. Unlike the previous studies (Ahrens, 1990, Origin of the Earth, H.E. Newson, J.H. Jones (Eds.), pp. 211–227; Ahrens, 1993, Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 21, 525–555; Chen and Ahrens, 1997, Phys. Earth Planet. Inter. 100, 21–26); the estimated loss fraction for the giant impact is only 20{\%}. Significant escape occurs only when the ground velocity is close to the escape velocity. Thus, most of the atmosphere should survive the giant impact. The cause of the difference from previous estimates is discussed from energetic and dynamic points of view. Moreover, if our estimates are applied to the atmosphere of the impactor planet, a significant fraction of it is carried to the target planet. Survival of the proto-atmosphere has very important effects on the origin and evolution of the terrestrial planets' volatile budget.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an Earth-sized planet (1.16 $\backslash$pm 0.19 R ⊕) in an 8.5 hr orbit around a late G-type star (KIC 8435766, Kepler-xx). The object was identified in a search for short-period planets in the Kepler database and confirmed to be a transiting planet (as opposed to an eclipsing stellar system) through the absence of ellipsoidal light variations or substantial radial-velocity variations. The unusually short orbital period and the relative brightness of the host star (m Kep = 11.5) enable robust detections of the changing illumination of the visible hemisphere of the planet, as well as the occultations of the planet by the star. We interpret these signals as representing a combination of reflected and reprocessed light, with the highest planet dayside temperature in the range of 2300 K-3100 K. Follow-up spectroscopy combined with finer sampling photometric observations will further pin down the system parameters and may even yield the mass of the planet.},

abstract = {Asteroids with satellites are observed throughout the Solar System, from subkilometre near-Earth asteroid pairs to systems of large and distant bodies in the Kuiper belt. The smallest and closest systems are found among the near-Earth and small inner main-belt asteroids, which typically have rapidly rotating primaries and close secondaries on circular orbits. About 15 per cent of near-Earth and main-belt asteroids with diameters under 10 km have satellites. The mechanism that forms such similar binaries in these two dynamically different populations was hitherto unclear. Here we show that these binaries are created by the slow spinup of a 'rubble pile' asteroid by means of the thermal YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack) effect. We find that mass shed from the equator of a critically spinning body accretes into a satellite if the material is collisionally dissipative and the primary maintains a low equatorial elongation. The satellite forms mostly from material originating near the primary's surface and enters into a close, low-eccentricity orbit. The properties of binaries produced by our model match those currently observed in the small near-Earth and main-belt asteroid populations, including 1999 KW(4) (refs 3, 4).},

abstract = {Our understanding of binary asteroids is currently undergoing major revisions. Until recently, all known small binaries (primary diameters {\~{}}=1 km) were near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), making it plausible that they originate in close encounters with terrestrial planets, and were not to be found among the main belt asteroids (MBAs). First simulations of tidal disruption have produced incidence of binaries that roughly matched the observed fraction of binary NEAs. Thermal-radiation effects, most notably YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack), were not needed to explain the life cycle of binary asteroids, despite some theoretical arguments in favor of significant YORP evolution. Recent discovery of abundant small MBA binaries and a more self-consistent reassessment of effects of planetary encounters have put the primacy of planetary encounters in doubt and shown a need for new theoretical explanations. Here I show that the mass loss from the primary's surface due to YORP could explain the formation of kilometer-sized binary NEAs. I also suggest that the small-separation NEA binaries' observed properties are consistent with evolution through ``binary YORP,'' rather than tidal stripping during planetary passages (when the pairs evolve beyond {\~{}}10 primary radii, encounters become important). Such a life cycle implies not only the extreme youth of small binary asteroids ({\textless}105 yr) but also short timescales for large-scale mass redistribution on most kilometer-sized asteroids, leading to a near-complete lack of craters on their surfaces.},

They are found throughout the Solar System, and present a challenge for theorists modeling their formation in the context of Solar System evolution. The most promising models invoke rotational disruption for the smallest, shortest-lived objects (the asteroids nearest to Earth), consistent with the observed fast rotation of these bodies; impacts for the larger, longer-lived asteroids in the main belt, consistent with the range of size ratios of their components and slower rotation rates; and mutual capture for the distant, icy, trans-Neptunian objects, consistent with their large component separations and near-equal sizes.

abstract = {The study of the equilibrium and stability of spinning ellipsoidal fluid bodies with gravity began with Newton in 1687, and continues to the present day. However, no smaller bodies of the Solar System are fluid. Here I model those bodies as elastic-plastic solids using a cohesionless Mohr-Coulomb yield envelope characterized by an angle of friction. This study began in Holsapple 2001. Here new closed-form algebraic formulas for the spin limits of ellipsoidal shapes are derived using an energy method. The fluid results of Maclaurin and Jacobi are again recovered as special cases. I then consider the stability of those equilibrium states. For elastic-plastic solids the common methods cannot be used, because the constitutive equations lack sufficient smoothness at the limiting plastic states. Therefore, I propose and study a new measure of the stability of dynamic processes in general bodies. An energy-based approach is introduced which is shown to include stability approaches used in the statics of nonlinear elastic and elastic-plastic bodies, spectral definitions and the Liapunov methods used for finite-dimensional dynamical systems. The method is applied to spinning, solid, strained bodies. In contrast to the special fluid case, it is found that the strain energy term of solid materials generally induces stability of all equilibrium shapes, except for two possible cases. First, strain softening in the elastic-plastic law can result in instability at the plastic limit spin. Second, a loss of shear stiffness can give unstable states at specific spins less than the limit equilibrium spins. In the latter case, a solid spinning ellipsoidal body without elastic shear stiffness can spin no faster than with a period of about 3.7 hr, else it will fail by shearing deformations. That is distinctly slower than the oft-quoted limit of 2.1 hr at which material would be flung off the equator by tensile forces. However, the final conclusion is that neither cohesion nor tensile strength is required for the shapes and spins of almost all of the larger observed asteroids: we cannot rule out rubble-pile structures. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Advances in our understanding of terrestrial planet formation have come from a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the ages and compositions of primitive meteorites with compositions similar to the Sun have helped to constrain the nature of the building blocks of planets. This information helps to guide numerical models for the three stages of planet formation from dust to planetesimals ({\~{}}10(6) y), followed by planetesimals to embryos (lunar to Mars-sized objects; few 10(6) y), and finally embryos to planets (10(7)-10(8) y). Defining the role of turbulence in the early nebula is a key to understanding the growth of solids larger than meter size. The initiation of runaway growth of embryos from planetesimals ultimately leads to the growth of large terrestrial planets via large impacts. Dynamical models can produce inner Solar System configurations that closely resemble our Solar System, especially when the orbital effects of large planets (Jupiter and Saturn) and damping mechanisms, such as gas drag, are included. Experimental studies of terrestrial planet interiors provide additional constraints on the conditions of differentiation and, therefore, origin. A more complete understanding of terrestrial planet formation might be possible via a combination of chemical and physical modeling, as well as obtaining samples and new geophysical data from other planets (Venus, Mars, or Mercury) and asteroids.},

In this paper, we describe the construction of the list, and we present results of our study of angular momentum content in binary asteroids. The most abundant binary population is that of close binary systems among near-Earth, Mars-crossing, and main belt asteroids that have a primary diameter of about 10 km or smaller. They have a total angular momentum very close to, but not generally exceeding, the critical limit for a single body in a gravity regime. This suggests that they formed from parent bodies spinning at the critical rate (at the gravity spin limit for asteroids in the size range) by some sort of fission or mass shedding. The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect is a candidate to be the dominant source of spin-up to instability.

abstract = {In an important paper, Roberts (1963b) studied the hydrostatic equilibrium of an isolated, self-gravitating, rapidly rotating polytropic gaseous body based on a controversial assumption/approximation that all (outer and internal) equidensity surfaces are in the shape of oblate spheroids whose eccentricities are a function of the equatorial radius and whose axes of symmetry are parallel to the rotation axis. We compute the three-dimensional, finite-element, fully self-consistent, continuous solution for a rapidly rotating polytropic gaseous body with Jupiter-like parameters without making any prior assumptions about its outer shape and internal structure. Upon partially relaxing the Roberts' approximation by assuming that only the outer equidensity surface is in the shape of an oblate spheroid, we also compute a finite-element solution with the same parameters without making any prior assumptions about its internal structure. It is found that all equidensity surfaces of the fully self-consistent solution differ only slightly from the oblate spheroidal shape. It is also found that the characteristic difference between the fully self-consistent solution and the outer-spheroidal-shape solution is insignificantly small. Our results suggest that the Roberts' assumption of spheroidal equidensity surfaces represents a reasonably accurate approximation for rotating polytropic gaseous bodies with Jupiter-like parameters. The numerical accuracy of our finite-element solution is checked by an exact analytic solution based on the Green's function using the spheroidal wave function. The three different solutions in non-spherical geometries – the fully self-consistent numerical solution, the numerical solution with the outer spheroidal shape and the exact analytical solution – can also serve as a useful benchmark for other solutions based on different numerical methods.},

@incollection{Peale2015,
abstract = {This critical review of the current thoughts on the origin of the natural satellites in the solar system includes discussions of the virtues and caveats of numerous theories and points out problems in need of further research. The widely accepted origin of the Moon as resulting from a giant impact of a Mars-sized body on the primitive Earth has been complicated by the need to accommodate several examples of elements with identical isotope ratios in the Earth and Moon. Problems in the dynamic evolution of the Earth–Moon system remain to be resolved in the two modified impact schemes suggested to allow identical compositions of the Moon and Earth's mantle. Mars' satellites formed from a disk of debris, the possible different compositions of the satellites from Mars notwithstanding. The dynamic evolution of the satellites to the present configuration after formation is shown to be consistent with such an origin, although the origin of the disk remains uncertain. A model of Jupiter's satellite formation in a starved accretion disk in the last stages of the formation of Jupiter, where several generations of satellites form that are lost by migration into Jupiter, produces a system within the constraints of observation. But problems remain in the delivery of solids to the disk, justifying the values of the turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha$ assumed and the treatment of a time-varying opacity during the accretion process. The Saturn system of satellites is the least understood of all the systems. Nearly all the mass of the satellites is within the single large satellite Titan, and the small, generally ice-rich satellites interior to Titan show a nonmonotonic ice to rock ratio as a function of orbital radius. Tethys must be nearly pure ice. A scheme for getting icy satellites close to Saturn where one would have expected rocky satellites involves spawning the satellites from a nearly pure ice particle ring, where the latter would result from the tidal stripping of the outer ice layers from a large, differentiated satellite as the latter spirals toward its destruction in Saturn. But a viable evolution of satellites so created coupled with other satellites still migrating toward Saturn into the current configuration and the deposition of rock into some of these satellites in an uneven distribution leaving a pure ice Tethys has yet to be demonstrated. The origin of the satellites of Uranus is complicated by the apparent necessity of a giant impact to account for Uranus' large obliquity. An existing satellite system would be destroyed during the impact process, but the equatorial disk so formed by the debris can rotate in the same retrograde direction as Uranus' spin only if Uranus already had a significant obliquity before the final impact. In this latter case, a satellite system like that observed could be reassembled. The understanding of the Neptune system configuration is more secure than that for any other satellite system. The capture of the large retrograde satellite Triton by the disruption of a binary asteroid as it passes close to Neptune is dynamically sound and probable. The small prograde satellites interior to Triton's orbit are reaccreted objects after the destruction of the original system during the tidal decay of Triton's initially very eccentric orbit. Like the Moon, Charon, the large satellite of Pluto, was almost certainly the result of a giant impact to account for the large system-specific angular momentum. However, the origin of the four small satellites exterior to Charon's orbit cannot be the result of transport of collisional debris to their current positions locked in mean motion resonances with Charon as the latter's orbit tidally expands to the current state of dual synchronous rotation. The origin of the small Pluto satellites is still a mystery. The distribution of irregular satellites with distant orbits around the four major planets is consistent with their being captured objects from the planetesimal population in the solar nebula, where capture is achieved through several effective mechanisms.},

abstract = {The development and evolution of a circumplanetary disk during the accretion of a giant planet is examined. The planet gains mass and angular momentum from infalling solar nebula material while simultaneously contracting due to luminosity losses. When the planet becomes rotationally unstable it begins to shed material into a circumplanetary disk. Viscosity causes the disk to spread to a moderate fraction of the Hill radius where it is assumed that a small fraction of the material escapes back into heliocentric orbit, carrying away most of the excess angular momentum. As the planet's contraction continues, its radius can become smaller than the spatial range of the inflow and material begins to fall directly onto the disk, which switches from a spin-out disk to an accretion disk as the planet completes its growth. We here develop a description of the circumplanetary disk, which is combined with models of the planet's contraction and the inflow rate including its angular momentum content to yield a solution for the time evolution of a planet-disk system.},

The conventional explanation is that the HSEs were stripped from the mantle by the segregation of metal during core formation but were added back in near-chondritic proportions by late accretion, after core formation had ceased. Here we show that metal-silicate equilibration and segregation during Earth's core formation actually increased HSE mantle concentrations because HSE partition coefficients are relatively low at the high pressures of core formation within Earth. The pervasive exsolution and segregation of iron sulfide liquid from silicate liquid (the “Hadean matte”) stripped magma oceans of HSEs during cooling and crystallization, before late accretion, and resulted in slightly suprachondritic palladium/iridium and ruthenium/iridium ratios.},

@article{Lissauer2009,
abstract = {We model the growth of Jupiter via core nucleated accretion, applying constraints from hydrodynamical processes that result from the disk–planet interaction. We compute the planet's internal structure using a well tested planetary formation code that is based upon a Henyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the protoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous models of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be approximately one Hill sphere radius, RH. However, 3-D hydrodynamic simulations show that only gas within ∼0.25RH remains bound to the planet, with the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the protoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer boundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach the portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller radius increases the time required for planetary growth by ∼5{\%}. Thermal pressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as massive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas hydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a moderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is about equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits to accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. Observations suggest that the typical lifetime of massive disks around young stellar objects is ∼3 Myr. To account for the dissipation of such disks, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's growth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on this timescale. In all of the cases that we simulate, the planet's effective radiating temperature rises to well above 1000 K soon after hydrodynamic limits begin to control the rate of gas accretion and the planet's distended envelope begins to contract. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and thermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current retinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al. [Pollack, J.B., Burns, J.A., Tauber, M.E., 1979. Icarus 37, 587–611].},

abstract = {We study the masses and radii of 65 exoplanets smaller than 4 Earth radii with orbital periods shorter than 100 days. We calculate the weighted mean densities of planets in bins of 0.5 Earth radii and identify a density maximum of 7.6 g/cc at 1.4 Earth radii. Planets with radii up to R = 1.5 Earth radii increase in density with increasing radius. Above 1.5 Earth radii, planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. Including the solar system terrestrial planets with the exoplanets below 1.5 Earth radii, we find $\backslash$rho = 2.43 + 3.39 (R/R{\_}E) g cm{\^{}}-3 for R {\textless} 1.5 Earth radii, which is consistent with rocky compositions. For exoplanets between 1.5 and 4 Earth radii, we find M/M{\_}E = 2.69 (R/R{\_}E){\^{}}0.93. The RMS of planet masses to the fit between 1.5 and 4 Earth radii is 4.3 M{\_}E with reduced $\backslash$chi{\^{}}2 = 6.2. The large scatter indicates a diversity in planet composition at a given radius. The compositional diversity can be due to planets of a given volume (as determined by their large H/He envelopes) containing rocky cores of different masses or compositions.},

abstract = {Kepler-93b is a 1.478 ± 0.019 R ⊕ planet with a 4.7 day period around a bright (V = 10.2), astroseismically characterized host star with a mass of 0.911 ± 0.033 M ⊙ and a radius of 0.919 ± 0.011 R ⊙. Based on 86 radial velocity observations obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and 32 archival Keck/HIRES observations, we present a precise mass estimate of 4.02 ± 0.68 M ⊕. The corresponding high density of 6.88 ± 1.18 g cm-3 is consistent with a rocky composition of primarily iron and magnesium silicate. We compare Kepler-93b to other dense planets with well-constrained parameters and find that between 1 and 6 M ⊕, all dense planets including the Earth and Venus are well-described by the same fixed ratio of iron to magnesium silicate. There are as of yet no examples of such planets with masses {\textgreater}6 M ⊕. All known planets in this mass regime have lower densities requiring significant fractions of volatiles or H/He gas. We also constrain the mass and period of the outer companion in the Kepler-93 system from the long-term radial velocity trend and archival adaptive optics images. As the sample of dense planets with well-constrained masses and radii continues to grow, we will be able to test whether the fixed compositional model found for the seven dense planets considered in this paper extends to the full population of 1-6 M ⊕ planets. Based on observations made with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island of La Palma by the Fundaci{\'{o}}n Galileo Galilei of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.},

We infer the likely radius, density, and (elastic limit) rigidity of all interior layers by solving the inverse problem using these observational constraints assuming spherical symmetry. Our results do not favor the presence of a low rigidity transition layer between a liquid outer core and mantle. If a transition layer exists, its rigidity is constrained to 43-9+26 GPa, with a preference for the high rigidity values. Therefore, if a transition layer exists, it is more likely to have a rigidity similar to that of the mantle (˜70 GPa). The total (solid and liquid) core mass fraction relative to the lunar mass is constrained to 0.0098-0.0094+0.0066 and 0.0198-0.0049+0.0026 for interior structures with and without a transition layer, respectively, narrowing the range of possible giant impact formation scenarios.},

abstract = {The Earth[rsquor]s magnetic field is powered by energy supplied by the slow cooling and freezing of the liquid iron core. Efforts to determine the thermal and chemical history of the core have been hindered by poor knowledge of the properties of liquid iron alloys at the extreme pressures and temperatures that exist in the core. This obstacle is now being overcome by high-pressure experiments and advanced mineral physics computations. Using these approaches, updated transport properties for Fe-Si-O mixtures have been determined at core conditions, including electrical and thermal conductivities that are higher than previous estimates by a factor of two to three. Models of core evolution with these high conductivities suggest that the core is cooling much faster than previously thought. This implies that the solid inner core formed relatively recently (around half a billion years ago), and that early core temperatures were high enough to cause partial melting of the lowermost mantle. Estimates of core-mantle boundary heat flow suggest that the uppermost core is thermally stratified at the present day.},

However, we observe that at temperatures exceeding the mantle liquidus, with increasing temperature the core S content required to satisfy the element depletions is reduced. As a S-poor core is likely from recent lunar mantle estimates of S abundance, this suggests much higher temperatures during lunar core formation than previously proposed.We conclude that the VSE depletions in the lunar mantle can be solely explained by core formation depletion, suggesting that no significant devolatilization has occurred in later periods of lunar evolution. This is in agreement with the discovery of significant amounts of other volatiles in the lunar interior, but hard to reconcile with current lunar formation models.},

We compare the velocity and density for any composition in the (Fe-Ni, C, O, Si, S) system to radial seismological models and find a range of compositional models that fit the seismological data. We find no oxygen-free composition that fits the seismological data, and therefore our results indicate that oxygen is always required in the outer core.

Despite the agreement, there are some differences in the detailed modeling that has been carried out. This paper will examine siderophile element metal/silicate partitioning with respect to three different topics: (1) an examination of aspects of the modeling that one might suspect leads to differences in outcomes or in comparison between models, but actually are in agreement with experimental data and between models; (2) a discussion of the role of the deep mantle in modeling efforts; and (3) the role and/or fate of volatiles in magma ocean scenarios with an emphasis on where data are lacking.},

abstract = {Current models assume that siderophile volatile elements (SVE) are depleted in bulk Earth to the same extent as lithophile elements of similar volatility. The observed additional depletion of many SVE relative to lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is ascribed to partitioning of SVE into Earth's core. However, the assumption of similar volatility of moderately volatile elements during Earth formation processes as in solar gas is quite uncertain. Here, these assumptions will be tested by assessing abundances and ratios of indium and cadmium in the BSE using new data on mantle rocks, and the application of high- and low-pressure-temperature metal-silicate partitioning data.New bulk rock abundance data of In and Cd obtained on bulk rocks of peridotite tectonites and xenoliths by isotope dilution refine previous results inferred from basalts and in-situ analyses of silicate minerals in peridotite xenoliths. The CI chondrite-normalized abundance of In in the BSE is similar to zinc and is 3-4 times higher than Cd. New and published low- and high-P-T metal-silicate partitioning data indicate that, during core formation at a range of conditions, In is always more siderophile than Zn and Cd. Adding the fraction of these elements in Earth's core to the BSE results in bulk Earth compositions that yield higher CI chondrite normalized abundances of In in the bulk Earth compared to Zn and Cd. Because In is more volatile than Zn and Cd in gas of solar composition, suprachondritic In/Zn and In/Cd in the bulk Earth suggest that during formation of Earth or its building materials, the volatilities of these elements and perhaps other volatile elements likely have changed significantly (i.e. In became less volatile). The results also suggest that known carbonaceous chondrites likely did not deliver the main volatile element-rich fraction of the Earth. Various arguments suggest that the loss of moderately volatile elements during planetary accretion should be limited, thus, their abundances in the bulk Earth likely reflect the average composition of Earth's building materials. Combined with evidence from nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies, the data suggest that Earth's main building materials originated from compartments of the inner solar system where volatile element abundances evolved differently from the formation area of known chondrites. The materials with nonchondritic volatile element composition may have been used up for building the terrestrial planets.},

abstract = {We present titanium stable isotope measurements of terrestrial magmatic samples and lunar mare basalts with the aims of constraining the composition of the lunar and terrestrial mantles and evaluating the potential of Ti stable isotopes for understanding magmatic processes. Relative to the OL–Ti isotope standard, the $\delta$49Ti values of terrestrial samples vary from −0.05 to +0.55‰, whereas those of lunar mare basalts vary from −0.01 to +0.03‰ (the precisions of the double spike Ti isotope measurements are ca. ±0.02‰ at 95{\%} confidence). The Ti stable isotope compositions of differentiated terrestrial magmas define a well-defined positive correlation with SiO2 content, which appears to result from the fractional crystallisation of Ti-bearing oxides with an inferred isotope fractionation factor of $\Delta$Tioxide–melt49=−0.23‰×106/T2. Primitive terrestrial basalts show no resolvable Ti isotope variations and display similar values to mantle-derived samples (peridotite and serpentinites), indicating that partial melting does not fractionate Ti stable isotopes and that the Earth's mantle has a homogeneous $\delta$49Ti composition of +0.005 ± 0.005 (95{\%} c.i., n=29). Eclogites also display similar Ti stable isotope compositions, suggesting that Ti is immobile during dehydration of subducted oceanic lithosphere. Lunar basalts have variable $\delta$49Ti values; low-Ti mare basalts have $\delta$49Ti values similar to that of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) while high-Ti lunar basalts display small enrichment in the heavy Ti isotopes. This is best interpreted in terms of source heterogeneity resulting from Ti stable isotope fractionation associated with ilmenite–melt equilibrium during the generation of the mantle source of high-Ti lunar mare basalts. The similarity in $\delta$49Ti between terrestrial samples and low-Ti lunar basalts provides strong evidence that the Earth and Moon have identical stable Ti isotope compositions.},

abstract = {According to the generally accepted scenario, the last giant impact on the Earth formed the Moon and initiated the final phase of core formation by melting the Earth's mantle. A key goal of geochemistry is to date this event, but different ages have been proposed. Some argue for an early Moon-forming event, approximately 30 million years (Myr) after the condensation of the first solids in the Solar System, whereas others claim a date later than 50 Myr (and possibly as late as around 100 My) after condensation. Here we show that a Moon-forming event at 40 Myr after condensation, or earlier, is ruled out at a 99.9 per cent confidence level. We use a large number of N-body simulations to demonstrate a relationship between the time of the last giant impact on an Earth-like planet and the amount of mass subsequently added during the era known as Late Accretion. As the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accreted mass decreases in a predictable fashion. This relationship exists within both the classical scenario and the Grand Tack scenario of terrestrial planet formation, and it holds across a wide range of disk conditions. The concentration of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle constrains the mass of chondritic material added to Earth during Late Accretion. Using HSE abundance measurements, we determine a Moon-formation age of 95 +/- 32 Myr since condensation. The possibility exists that some late projectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete HSE record in Earth's mantle. Even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest that the late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of Earth's mass, and so the HSE clock still robustly limits the timing of the Moon-forming event to significantly later than 40 My after condensation.},

abstract = {The giant impact theory is the most widely recognized formation scenario of the Earth's Moon. Giant impact models based on dynamical simulations predict that the Moon acquired a significant amount of impactor (Theia) material, which is challenging to reconcile with geochemical data for O, Si, Cr, Ti and W isotopes in the Earth and Moon. Three new giant impact scenarios have been proposed to account for this discrepancy – hit-and-run impact, impact with a fast-spinning protoEarth and massive impactors – each one reducing the proportion of the impactor in the Moon compared to the original canonical giant impact model. The validity of each theory and their different dynamical varieties are evaluated here using an integrated approach that considers new high-precision Zr isotope measurements of lunar rocks, and quantitative geochemical modelling of the isotopic composition of the impactor Theia. All analysed lunar samples (whole-rock, ilmenite and pyroxene separates) display identical Zr isotope compositions to that of the Earth within the uncertainty of 13 ppm for 96Zr/90Zr (2$\sigma$ weighted average). This 13 ppm upper limit is used to infer the most extreme isotopic composition that Theia could have possessed, relative to the Earth, for each of the proposed giant impact theories. The calculated Theian composition is compared with the Zr isotope compositions of different solar system materials in order to constrain the source region of the impactor. As a first order approximation, we show that all considered models (including the canonical) are plausible, alleviating the initial requirement for the new giant impact models. Albeit, the canonical and hit-and-run models are the most restrictive, suggesting that the impactor originated from a region close to the Earth. The fast-spinning protoEarth and massive impactor models are more relaxed and increase the allowed impactor distance from the Earth. Similar calculations carried out for O, Cr, Ti and Si isotope data support these conclusions but exclude a CI- and enstatite chondrite-like composition for Theia. Thus, the impactor Theia most likely had a Zr isotope composition close to that of the Earth, and this suggests that a large part of the inner solar system (or accretion region of the Earth, Theia and enstatite chondrites) had a uniform Zr isotope composition.},

The four largest planets in our solar$\backslash$nsystem contain considerable quantities of hydrogen and helium; these$\backslash$ngases could not have condensed into solid planetesimals within the$\backslash$nprotoplanetary disk. Jupiter and Saturn are mostly hydrogen and helium,$\backslash$nbut have larger abundances of heavier elements than does the Sun.$\backslash$nNeptune and Uranus are primarily composed of heavier elements.

abstract = {We present global hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with mesh refinement of accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). The magnetized disk includes Ohmic resistivity that depends on the overlying mass column, leading to turbulent surface layers and a dead zone near the midplane. The main results are: (1) the accretion flow in the Hill sphere is intrinsically three-dimensional for HD and MHD models. Net inflow toward the planet is dominated by high-latitude flows. A circumplanetary disk (CPD) forms. Its midplane flows outward in a pattern whose details differ between models. (2) The opening of a gap magnetically couples and ignites the dead zone near the planet, leading to stochastic accretion, a quasi-turbulent flow in the Hill sphere, and a CPD whose structure displays high levels of variability. (3) Advection of magnetized gas onto the rotating CPD generates helical fields that launch magnetocentrifugally driven outflows. During one specific epoch, a highly collimated, one-sided jet is observed. (4) The CPD's surface density is {\{}$\backslash$sim {\}}30$\backslash$,g$\backslash$,cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}, small enough for significant ionization and turbulence to develop. (5) The accretion rate onto the planet in the MHD simulation reaches a steady value 8 × 10-3 M ⊕ yr-1 and is similar in the viscous HD runs. Our results suggest that gas accretion onto a forming giant planet within a magnetized PPD with a dead zone allows rapid growth from Saturnian to Jovian masses. As well as being relevant for giant planet formation, these results have important implications for the formation of regular satellites around gas giant planets.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of planetesimals in evolved gaseous disks that orbit a solar-mass star and harbor a Jupiter- mass planet at a p 5≈ AU. The gas dynamics are modeled with a three-dimensional hydrodynamics code that employs nested grids and achieves a resolution of one Jupiter radius in the circumplanetary disk. The code models solids as individual particles. Planetesimals are subjected to gravitational forces by the star and the planet, a drag force by the gas, disruption via ram pressure, and mass loss through ablation. The mass evolution of solids is calculated self-consistently with their temperature, velocity, and position. We consider icy and icy/rocky bodies of radius 0.1–100 km, initially deployed on orbits around the star within a few Hill radii (RH) of the planetʼs orbit. Planetesimals are scattered inward, outward, and toward disk regions of radius r ≫ ap. Scattering can relocate significant amounts of solids, provided that regions ra 3 ∣ −∣∼ RH are replenished with planetesimals. Scattered p bodies can be temporarily captured on planetocentric orbits. Ablation consumes nearly all solids at gas temperatures 220≳ K. Super-Keplerian rotation around and beyond the outer edge of the gas gap can segregate ≲0.1 km bodies, producing solid gap edges at size-dependent radial locations. Capture, break-up, and ablation of solids result in a dust-laden circumplanetary disk with low surface densities of kilometer sized planetesimals, implying relatively long timescales for satellite formation. After a giant planet acquires most of its mass, accretion of solids is unlikely to significantly alter its heavy element content. The luminosity generated by accretion of solids and the contraction luminosity can be of similar orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {With a series of numerical simulations, we analyze the thermohydrodynamic evolution of circumstellar disks containing Jupiter-sized protoplanets. In the framework of a two-dimensional approximation, we consider an energy equation that includes viscous heating and radiative effects in a simplified yet consistent form. Multiple nested grids are used in order to study both global and local features around the planet. By means of different viscosity prescriptions, we investigate various temperature regimes. A planetary mass range from 0.1 to 1 MJ is examined. Computations show that gap formation is a general property that affects density, pressure, temperature, optical thickness, and radiated flux distributions. However, it remains a prominent feature only when the kinematic viscosity is on the order of 1015 cm2 s-1 or lower, although it becomes rather shallow for 0.1 MJ perturbers. Around accreting planets, a circumplanetary disk forms that has a surface density profile decaying exponentially with distance and whose mass is 5-6 orders of magnitude smaller than Jupiter's mass. Circumplanetary disk temperature profiles decline roughly as the inverse of the distance from the planet, matching the values measured in the gap toward the border of the Roche lobe. Temperatures range from some 10 to {\~{}}1000 K. Moreover, circumplanetary disks are generally opaque, with optical thicknesses larger than 1 and aspect ratios around a few tenths. Nonaccreting protoplanets provide quite different scenarios, with a clockwise, i.e., reversed flow, rotation around low-mass bodies. Planetary accretion and migration rates depend on the viscosity regime, with discrepancies within an order of magnitude. Co-orbital torques increase as viscosity increases. For high viscosities, type I migration may extend to larger planetary masses. Estimates of growth and migration timescales inferred from these models are on the same orders of magnitude as those previously obtained with locally isothermal simulations, in both two and three dimensions.},

We find that the analytical prediction of circumplanetary disc radii in an evacuated gap (R{\_}Hill/3) from Quillen {\&} Trilling (1998) yields a good estimate for discs formed by high mass protoplanets. The radial density profiles of the circumplanetary discs may be described by power-laws between r{\^{}}-2 and r{\^{}}-3/2. We find no evidence for the ring-like density enhancements that have been found in some previous models of circumplanetary discs. Temperature profiles follow a {\~{}}r{\^{}}-7/10 power-law regardless of protoplanet mass or nebula grain opacity. The discs invariably have large scaleheights (H/r {\textgreater} 0.2), making them thick in comparison with their encompassing circumstellar discs, and they show no flaring.},

We find that high-mass protoplanets are surrounded by thick circumplanetary discs during their gas accretion phase but, contrary to locally isothermal calculations, discs do not form around accreting protoplanets with masses {\textless}{\~{}} when radiation hydrodynamical simulations are performed, even if the grain opacity is reduced from interstellar values by a factor of 100. We find that the opacity of the gas plays a large role in determining the accretion rates for low-mass planetary cores. For example, reducing the opacities from interstellar values by a factor of 100 leads to roughly an order of magnitude increase in the accretion rates for protoplanets. The dependence on opacity becomes less important in determining the accretion rate for more massive cores where gravity dominates the effects of thermal support and the protoplanet is essentially accreting at the runaway rate. Increasing the core mass from 10 to 100 M increases the accretion rate by a factor of {\~{}}50 for interstellar opacities. Beyond , the ability of the protoplanetary disc to supply material to the accreting protoplanet limits the accretion rate, independent of the opacity. Finally, for low-mass planetary cores ({\textless}{\~{}}), we obtain accretion rates that are in agreement with previous one-dimensional quasi-static models. This indicates that three-dimensional hydrodynamical effects may not significantly alter the gas accretion time-scales that have been obtained from quasi-static models.},

abstract = {Observational constraints on interior models of the giant planets indicate that these planets were all much hotter when they formed and they all have rock and/or ice cores of ten to thirty earth masses. These cores are probably soluble in the envelopes above, especially in Jupiter and Saturn, and are therefore likely to be primordial. They persist despite the continual upward mixing by thermally driven convection throughout the age of the solar system, because of the inefficiency of double-diffusive convection. Thus, these planets most probably formed by the hydrodynamic collapse of a gaseous envelope onto a core rather than by direct instability of the gaseous solar nebula. Recent calculations by Mizuno (1980, Prog. Theor. Phys. 64, 544) show that this formation mechanism may explain the similarity of giant planet core masses. Problems remain however, and no current model is entirely satisfactory in explaining the properties of the giant planets and simultaneously satisfying the terrestrial planet constraints. Satellite systematics and protoplanetary disk nebulae are also discussed and related to formation conditions. ?? 1982.},

@article{Levison2015,
abstract = {It is widely held that the first step in forming gas-giant planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, was the production of solid 'cores' each with a mass roughly ten times that of the Earth. Getting the cores to form before the solar nebula dissipates (in about one to ten million years; ref. 3) has been a major challenge for planet formation models. Recently models have emerged in which 'pebbles' (centimetre-to-metre-sized objects) are first concentrated by aerodynamic drag and then gravitationally collapse to form objects 100 to 1,000 kilometres in size. These 'planetesimals' can then efficiently accrete left-over pebbles and directly form the cores of giant planets. This model is known as 'pebble accretion'; theoretically, it can produce cores of ten Earth masses in only a few thousand years. Unfortunately, full simulations of this process show that, rather than creating a few such cores, it produces a population of hundreds of Earth-mass objects that are inconsistent with the structure of the Solar System. Here we report that this difficulty can be overcome if pebbles form slowly enough to allow the planetesimals to gravitationally interact with one another. In this situation, the largest planetesimals have time to scatter their smaller siblings out of the disk of pebbles, thereby stifling their growth. Our models show that, for a large and physically reasonable region of parameter space, this typically leads to the formation of one to four gas giants between 5 and 15 astronomical units from the Sun, in agreement with the observed structure of the Solar System.},

abstract = {In the core accretion model for giant planet formation, a solid core forms by coagulation of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk and then accretes gas from the disk when the core reaches a critical mass. Both stages must be completed in a few million years before the disk gas disperses. The slowest stage of this process may be oligarchic growth in which a giant-planet core grows by sweeping up smaller, asteroid-size planetesimals. Here, we describe new numerical simulations of oligarchic growth using a particle-in-a-box model. The simulations include several processes that can effect oligarchic growth: (i) planetesimal fragmentation due to mutual collisions, (ii) the modified capture rate of planetesimals due to a core's atmosphere, (iii) drag with the disk gas during encounters with the core (so-called "pebble accretion"), (iv) modification of particle velocities by turbulence and drift caused by gas drag, (v) the presence of a population of mm-to-m size "pebbles" that represent the transition point between disruptive collisions between larger particles, and mergers between dust grains, and (vi) radial drift of small objects due to gas drag. Collisions between planetesimals rapidly generate a population of pebbles. The rate at which a core sweeps up pebbles is controlled by pebble accretion dynamics. Metre-size pebbles lose energy during an encounter with a core due to drag, and settle towards the core, greatly increasing the capture probability during a single encounter. Millimetre-size pebbles are tightly coupled to the gas and most are swept past the core during an encounter rather than being captured. Accretion efficiency per encounter increases with pebble size in this size range. However, radial drift rates also increase with size, so metre-size objects encounter a core on many fewer occasions than mm-size pebbles before they drift out of a region. The net result is that core growth rates vary weakly with pebble size, with the optimal diameter being about 10cm. The main effect of planetesimal size is to determine the rate of mutual collisions, fragment production and the formation of pebbles. 1-km-diameter planetesimals collide frequently and have low impact strengths, leading to a large surface density of pebbles and rapid core growth via pebble accretion. 100-km-diameter planetesimals produce fewer pebbles, and pebble accretion plays a minor role in this case. The strength of turbulence in the gas determines the scale height of pebbles in the disk, which affects the rate at which they are accreted. For an initial solid surface density of12g/cm2 at 5AU, with 10-cm diameter pebbles and a disk viscosity parameter ?? = 10 - 4, a 10-Earth mass core can form in 3My for 1-10km diameter planetesimals. The growth of such a core requires longer than 3My if planetesimals are 100km in diameter. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present three-dimensional simulations with nested meshes of the dynamics of the gas around a Jupiter mass planet with the JUPITER and FARGOCA codes. We implemented a radiative transfer module into the JUPITER code to account for realistic heating and cooling of the gas. We focus on the circumplanetary gas flow, determining its characteristics at very high resolution ({\$}80\backslash{\%}{\$} of Jupiter's diameter). In our nominal simulation where the temperature evolves freely by the radiative module and reaches 13000 K at the planet, a circumplanetary envelope was formed filling the entire Roche-lobe. Because of our equation of state is simplified and probably overestimates the temperature, we also performed simulations with limited maximal temperatures in the planet region (1000 K, 1500 K, and 2000 K). In these fixed temperature cases circumplanetary disks (CPDs) were formed. This suggests that the capability to form a circumplanetary disk is not simply linked to the mass of the planet and its ability to open a gap. Instead, the gas temperature at the planet's location, which depends on its accretion history, plays also fundamental role. The CPDs in the simulations are hot and cooling very slowly, they have very steep temperature and density profiles, and are strongly sub-Keplerian. Moreover, the CPDs are fed by a strong vertical influx, which shocks on the CPD surfaces creating a hot and luminous shock-front. In contrast, the pressure supported circumplanetary envelope is characterized by internal convection and almost stalled rotation.},

Criticisms which caused rejection of the older hypothesis are considered in the light of this modification and of subsequent discoveries and ideas. Most severe is lack of angular momentum in the present earth-moon system, a criticism which is itself open to question in terms of possible magnetic frictions during the early history of the solar system; observed but presently unexplainable components in rate of change in rotation of the earth; possible changes in diameter of the earth with time. Among the explanations provided by the hypothesis are relatively circular lunar orbit, specific gravity of the moon, apparent nonhydrostatic figure of the moon, constant face toward the earth, and gross sequence of geologic events recorded on the lunar face. Several proposed tests of the hypothesis should soon be possible. Until more data become available, it is suggested that a lunar birth from the earth be reinstated among our current working hypotheses.},

The method is based on three time scales: short, determined by the revolution periods of the earth and moon around the sun and earth, respectively; intermediate, set by precessional motions of the moon's orbit plane and the earth's equator plane; and long, defined by the rate at which the frictional tides alter the state of the earth-moon system. The principle dynamic features of the sun-earth-moon system in the absence of tidal forces are described by precessional equations. It is shown that for each planet there is a critical distance such that a satellite orbit lying well within the distance will maintain a nearly constant inclination to the planet's equator plane; the present earth-moon distance is far greater than the critical distance. Equations of motion are presented for the slow changes in conserved quantities produced by frictionally retarded tides, the principal changes being produced by the tides raised on the earth by the moon, and smaller changes by the tides raised on the earth by the sun. Fission and capture theories of lunar origin and formation in earth orbit are mentioned.},

abstract = {One of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead to explosions that reproduce observations of normal events. Here we present a fully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with masses of {\$}0.9 mathrmModot and {\$}1.1 mathrmModot combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. A well-tested combination of codes is used to study the system. We start with the dynamical inspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under the plausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. We then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfer simulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expanding supernova ejecta. We find that synthetic color lightcurves of our merger, which produces about {\$}0.62 mathrmModot of 56mathrmNi, show good agreement with those observed for normal SNe Ia in all wave bands from U to K. Line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well with observations. We conclude, that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs can closely resemble normal SNe Ia. Therefore, depending on the number of such massive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a small fraction to the observed population of normal SNe Ia.},

abstract = {Rotation is thought to be a major factor in the evolution of massive stars—especially at low metallicity—with consequences for their chemical yields, ionizing flux, and final fate. Deriving the birth spin distribution is of high priority given its importance as a constraint on theories of massive star formation and as input for models of stellar populations in the local universe and at high redshift. Recently, it has become clear that the majority of massive stars interact with a binary companion before they die. We investigate how this affects the distribution of rotation rates, through stellar winds, expansion, tides, mass transfer, and mergers. For this purpose, we simulate a massive binary-star population typical for our Galaxy assuming continuous star formation. We find that, because of binary interaction, 20+5 –10{\%} of all massive main-sequence stars have projected rotational velocities in excess of 200 km s–1. We evaluate the effect of uncertain input distributions and physical processes and conclude that the main uncertainties are the mass transfer efficiency and the possible effect of magnetic braking, especially if magnetic fields are generated or amplified during mass accretion and stellar mergers. The fraction of rapid rotators we derive is similar to that observed. If indeed mass transfer and mergers are the main cause for rapid rotation in massive stars, little room remains for rapidly rotating stars that are born single. This implies that spin-down during star formation is even more efficient than previously thought. In addition, this raises questions about the interpretation of the surface abundances of rapidly rotating stars as evidence for rotational mixing. Furthermore, our results allow for the possibility that all early-type Be stars result from binary interactions and suggest that evidence for rotation in explosions, such as long gamma-ray bursts, points to a binary origin.},

We have analyzed Ne trapped in fluid inclusions from plume-related Devonian rocks from the Kola Peninsula, Russia. The lower limit for pristine neon in the deep mantle is set at 20Ne/22Ne≥13.0±0.2, close to the solar wind (SW) value. We interpret this similarity as evidence that mantle light noble gases were directly incorporated from the solar nebula rather than derived from implanted meteoritic solar component, possibly through gravitational capture of a proto-atmosphere. This constraint is consistent with geochemical observations of rapid accretion of a major part of the growing Earth within the inferred lifetime of the solar nebula. If depleted mantle neon admits an upper limit of 12.5, then the occurrence of plume type neon with 20Ne/22Ne≥13.0±0.2 may indicate a primordial Ne heterogeneity in the mantle. The 3He/22Ne ratios of terrestrial mantle reservoirs sampled by MORB and plumes vary with the degree of volatile element depletion of the mantle. This correlation was possibly established during magmatic events having led to the chemical characteristics of the depleted mantle reservoir.},

abstract = {The present-day inclination of the Moon reflects the entire history of its thermal and orbital evolution. The Moon likely possessed a global magma ocean following the Moon-forming impact. In this work, we develop a coupled thermal-orbital evolution model that takes into account obliquity tidal heating in the lunar magma ocean. Dissipation in the magma ocean is so effective that it results in rapid inclination damping at semi-major axes beyond about 20 Earth radii (RE), because of the increase in lunar obliquity as the so-called Cassini state transition at ≈30 RE is approached. There is thus a “speed limit” on how fast the Moon can evolve outwards while maintaining its inclination: if it reaches 20 RE before the magma ocean solidifies, any early lunar inclination cannot be maintained. We find that for magma ocean lifetimes of 10 Myr or more, the Earth's tidal quality factor Q must have been {\textgreater}300 to maintain primordial inclination, implying an early Earth 1–2 orders of magnitude less dissipative than at present. On the other hand, if tidal dissipation on the early Earth was stronger, our model implies rapid damping of the lunar inclination and requires subsequent late excitation of the lunar orbit after the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean.},

abstract = {The structure and viscous evolution of a post-impact, protolunar disc is examined. The equations for a silicate disc in two-phase (vapour-liquid) equilibrium are employed to derive an analytical solution to vertical structure. Both a vertically mixed phase disc and a stratified disc, where a magma layer exists in the mid-plane surrounded by a vapour reservoir, are considered. The former largely reproduces the low gas mass fraction, x≪1, profiles of the disc described in earlier literature that proposed that the disc would hover on the brink of gravitational instability. In the latter, the vapour layer has x∼1 and is generally gravitationally stable, while the magma layer is vigorously unstable. The viscous evolution of the stratified model is then explored. Initially, the disc quickly settles to a quasi-steady state with a vapour reservoir containing the majority of the disc mass. The magma layer viscously spreads on a time scale of approximately 3-4 years, during which vapour continuously condenses into droplets that settle to the mid-plane, maintaining the magma surface density in spite of disc spreading. Material flowing inwards is accreted by the Earth; material flowing outwards past the Roche boundary can become incorporated into accreting moonlets. This evolution persists until the vapour reservoir is depleted in approximately 50-100 years, depending on its initial mass.},

abstract = {The mixing‐length theory of turbulent thermal convection in a gravitationally unstable fluid is extended to yield the dependence of Nusselt number H/H 0 on both Prandtl number $\sigma$ and Rayleigh number Ra. The analysis assumes a layer of Boussinesq fluid contained between infinite, horizontal, perfectly conducting, rigid plates. Also obtained is the dependence of mean temperature deviation T̄(z), rms temperature fluctuation $\psi$̃(z), and rms velocity upon height z above the bottom plate. The theory gives H/H 0 ∝ Ra1/3 (high $\sigma$), H/H 0 ∝ ($\sigma$ Ra)1/3 (low $\sigma$), and H/H 0 ∼ 1 (very low $\sigma$). The boundaries of the several $\sigma$ ranges are determined. At one intermediate Prandtl number only, the behavior of T̄(z) and $\psi$̃(z) reduces to that previously found by Priestly. At high $\sigma$, there is a range of z, outside the molecular conduction region, where T̄(z) ∝ z −1, $\psi$̃(z) ∝ z −1. The results at very low $\sigma$ reduce to those of Ledoux, Schwarzschild, and Spiegel. The dynamics are found to be importantly modified at extremely large Ra because of the stirring action of small‐scale turbulence generated in shear boundary layers attached to the eddies of largest scale. The consequent corrected asymptotic law of heat transport at fixed $\sigma$ is H/H 0 ∝ [Ra/(In Ra)3]1/2.},

The growth rates and length scales of the most unstable modes are determined. It is found that these modes are either zonally or latitudinally symmetric, depending on the latitude and the horizontal temperature gradient. The transports of heat and momentum by the modes are computed. The linear amplitudes are assumed to be limited by shear instability. The model predicts a latitude dependent eddy diffusivity.

Small and large magnetic diffusivity limits are both considered. A finite amplitude theory is constructed by assuming that non-linearities (e.g. shear instabilities) limit the flow amplitude, and the dominant modes are assumed to he those which transport most heat. This leads to a unique prescription for the average velocity, superadiabaticity and horizontal lengthscale as a function of the imposed heat flux, rotation rate, large scale magnetic field and vertical lengthscale. Simple analytical results are provided (in terms of the relevant dimensionless numbers) which are as easy to apply as the conventional mixing length theory (MLT). The conclusions are: (i) For no rotation or magnetic field, the model reproduces MLT except that it predicts about an order of magnitude lower heat flux.

In this study, we present a combination of direct numerical simulations and laboratory experiments, modeling this geophysically relevant mechanical forcing. We investigate the fluid motions inside a longitudinally librating ellipsoidal container filled with an incompressible fluid. The elliptical instability, which is a triadic resonance between two inertial modes and the oscillating base flow with elliptical streamlines, is observed both numerically and experimentally. The large-scale inertial modes eventually lead to small-scale turbulence, provided that the Ekman number is small enough. We characterize this transition to turbulence as additional triadic resonances develop while also investigating the properties of the turbulent flow that displays both intermittent and sustained regimes. These turbulent flows may play an important role in the thermal and magnetic evolution of bodies subject to mechanical forcing, which is not considered in standard models of convectively driven magnetic field generation.},

abstract = {We present laboratory experimental results demonstrating that librational forcing of an ellipsoidal container of water can produce intense motions through the mechanism of a libration driven elliptical instability (LDEI). These libration studies are conducted using an ellipsoidal acrylic container filled with water. A particle image velocimetry method is used to measure the 2D velocity field in the equatorial plane over hundreds libration cycles for a fixed Ekman number, E = 2 × 10−5. In doing so, we recover the libration induced base flow and a time averaged zonal flow. Further, we show that LDEI in non-axisymmetric container geometries is capable of driving both intermittent and saturated turbulent motions in the bulk fluid. Additionally, we measure the growth rate and amplitude of the LDEI induced excited flow in a fully ellipsoidal container at more extreme parameters than previously studied [Noir et al., “Experimental study of libration-driven flows in nonaxisymmetric containers,” Phys.

abstract = {It is thought that the Moon accreted from the protolunar disk that was assembled after the last giant impact on Earth. Due to its high temperature, the protolunar disk may act as a thermochemical reactor in which the material is processed before being incorporated into the Moon. Outstanding issues like devolatilisation and istotopic evolution are tied to the disk evolution, however its lifetime, dynamics and thermodynamics are unknown. Here, we numerically explore the long term viscous evolution of the protolunar disk using a one dimensional model where the different phases (vapor and condensed) are vertically stratified. Viscous heating, radiative cooling, phase transitions and gravitational instability are accounted for whereas Moon's accretion is not considered for the moment. The viscosity of the gas, liquid and solid phases dictates the disk evolution. We find that (1) the vapor condenses into liquid in ∼10years, (2) a large fraction of the disk mass flows inward forming a hot and compact liquid disk between 1 and 1.7 Earth's radii, a region where the liquid is gravitationally stable and can accumulate, (3) the disk finally solidifies in 103 to 105years. Viscous heating is never balanced by radiative cooling. If the vapor phase is abnormally viscous, due to magneto-rotational instability for instance, most of the disk volatile components are transported to Earth leaving a disk enriched in refractory elements. This opens a way to form a volatile-depleted Moon and would suggest that the missing Moon's volatiles are buried today into the Earth. The disk cooling timescale may be long enough to allow for planet/disk isotopic equilibration. However large uncertainties on the disk physics remain because of the complexity of its multi-phased structure.},

abstract = {The relationship between solar volatiles and those now in the Earth's atmosphere and mantle reservoirs provides insight into the processes controlling the acquisition of volatiles during planetary accretion and their subsequent evolution. Whereas the light noble gases (helium and neon) in the Earth's mantle preserve a solar-like isotopic composition, heavy noble gases (argon, krypton and xenon) have an isotopic composition very similar to that of the modern atmosphere, with radiogenic and (in the case of xenon) solar contributions. Mantle noble gases in a magmatic CO2 natural gas field have been previously corrected for shallow atmosphere/groundwater and crustal additions. Here we analyse new data from this field and show that the elemental composition of non-radiogenic heavy noble gases in the mantle is remarkably similar to that of sea water. We challenge the popular concept of a noble gas 'subduction barrier'--the convecting mantle noble gas isotopic and elemental composition is explained by subduction of sediment and seawater-dominated pore fluids. This accounts for approximately 100{\%} of the non-radiogenic argon and krypton and 80{\%} of the xenon. Approximately 50{\%} of the convecting mantle water concentration can then be explained by this mechanism. Enhanced recycling of subducted material to the mantle plume source region then accounts for the lower ratio of radiogenic to non-radiogenic heavy noble gas isotopes and higher water content of plume-derived basalts.},

abstract = {The distribution of Ga between solid Fe metal and synthetic basaltic melt has been investigated experimentally at two temperatures over a limited range of oxygen fugacities. Reversal experiments were conducted, indicating a close approach to equilibrium. Analysis of run products was performed using an electron and an ion microprobe. At 1 bar total pressure, the solid metal/silicate melt partition coefficient. D(Ga), is given by: 1190°C: logD(Ga) = −0.92 logfO2 − 11.91330°C: logD(Ga) = −0.77 logfO2 − 8.8. For the common assumption of a valence state for Ga of 3 in silicates and assuming ideal solution of Ga in both phases, a slope of −0.75 is predicted. The slope obtained at 1300°C (−0.77) is indistinguishable from this value, while the slope at 1190°C (−0.92) is somewhat higher. Henry's law is obeyed over the concentration range 0.007 wt.{\%} to 0.15 wt.{\%} Ga in metal, a factor of 20 in concentration. These partition coefficients may be utilized to evaluate metal/silicate fractionation processes in the Earth, Moon and Eucrite Parent Body. The lunar mantle appears to be depleted in Ga by a factor of 20–40 relative to CI abundances. This depletion is consistent with extraction of Ga into a geophysically plausible lunar core if Ga was initially present at a subchondritic concentration. A similar explanation probably accounts for the depletion of Ga in the Eucrite Parent Body. The upper mantle of the Earth appears to be depleted in Ga by a factor of 4– 7 relative to CI abundances. This depletion is far smaller than would be expected as a result of core formation, but is consistent with two quite different hypotheses: (i) a small amount of solid metal and sulfur-bearing metallic liquid was retained in the mantle after core formation; or (ii) addition of a late-stage chondritic component involving 5{\%} to 10{\%} of the upper mantle following core formation.},

abstract = {The chemical implications of a “giant impact” model for the origin of the Moon are examined, both for the Moon and for the Earth. The Impactor is taken to be an approximately Mars-sized body. It is argued that the likeliest bulk chemical composition of the Moon (including a small Ni-rich metallic core) is quite similar to that of the Earth's mantle, and that this composition may be explained in detail if about 80{\%} of the Moon came from the primitive Earth's mantle after segregation of the Earth's core. The other 20{\%} of the Moon is modelled as coming from (a) the Impactor, which is constrained to be an oxidized, probably undifferentiated body of roughly CI chondritic composition (on a volatile free basis) and (b) a late stage veneer, with a composition and oxidation state similar to that of the H-group ordinary chondrites. This latter component is the source of all the volatile elements in the Moon (e.g., Na, K, Rb, Cs, and the volatile siderophile elements such as Cu, Ge, etc.), which failed to condense from the Earthand Impactor-derived materials; this component constitutes about 4{\%} of the Moon. It is argued that Mo may behave as a volatile element under the relatively oxidising conditions necessary for the condensation of the proto-Moon. The late stage veneer may also be the reducing agent responsible for forming a small lunar core, which depletes the primitive silicate mantle of the Moon in the more siderophile elements. This core is presumed to have formed in equilibrium with the lunar mantle and, therefore, has Ni(Ni + Fe) = 0.45 ± 0.1; a mass balance of Ni in the Moon constrains the lunar core to ∼ 1{\%} of the Moon's mass. Metal separation to the core at an assumed temperature of 1300°C takes place at an oxygen fugacity 0.8 log-bar units below the iron-w{\"{u}}stite (IW) oxygen buffer. These conditions may then be used to calculate the siderophile trace element concentrations in the core-forming metal and thus the siderophile element abundances of the bulk Moon (core plus primitive mantle). The model accounts satisfactorily for most of the siderophile elements, including Fe, Ni, Co, W, P, and Cu. The relatively well-constrained lunar abundances of V, Cr, and Mn are also accounted for; their depletion in the Moon is inherited from the Earth's mantle. The consequences of the model for the composition of the Earth's mantle are addressed in O'Neill (1991).},

Here, we report in situ measurements of water in lunar melt inclusions; these samples of primitive lunar magma, by virtue of being trapped within olivine crystals before volcanic eruption, did not experience posteruptive degassing. The lunar melt inclusions contain 615 to 1410 ppm water and high correlated amounts of fluorine (50 to 78 ppm), sulfur (612 to 877 ppm), and chlorine (1.5 to 3.0 ppm). These volatile contents are very similar to primitive terrestrial mid-ocean ridge basalts and indicate that some parts of the lunar interior contain as much water as Earth's upper mantle.},

abstract = {The Moon is generally thought to have formed and evolved through a single or a series of catastrophic heating events, during which most of the highly volatile elements were lost. Hydrogen, being the lightest element, is believed to have been completely lost during this period. Here we make use of considerable advances in secondary ion mass spectrometry to obtain improved limits on the indigenous volatile (CO(2), H(2)O, F, S and Cl) contents of the most primitive basalts in the Moon-the lunar volcanic glasses. Although the pre-eruptive water content of the lunar volcanic glasses cannot be precisely constrained, numerical modelling of diffusive degassing of the very-low-Ti glasses provides a best estimate of 745 p.p.m. water, with a minimum of 260 p.p.m. at the 95 per cent confidence level. Our results indicate that, contrary to prevailing ideas, the bulk Moon might not be entirely depleted in highly volatile elements, including water. Thus, the presence of water must be considered in models constraining the Moon's formation and its thermal and chemical evolution.},

abstract = {Chemical differences between mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and ocean island basalts (OIBs) provide critical evidence that the Earth's mantle is compositionally heterogeneous. MORBs generally exhibit a relatively low and narrow range of (3)He/(4)He ratios on a global scale, whereas OIBs display larger variability in both time and space. The primordial origin of (3)He in OIBs has motivated hypotheses that high (3)He/(4)He ratios are the product of mantle plumes sampling chemically distinct material, but do not account for lower MORB-like (3)He/(4)He ratios in OIBs, nor their observed spatial and temporal variability. Here we perform thermochemical convection calculations which show the variable (3)He/(4)He signature of OIBs can be reproduced by deep isolated mantle reservoirs of primordial material that are viscously entrained by thermal plumes. Entrainment is highly time-dependent, producing a wide range of (3)He/(4)He ratios similar to that observed in OIBs worldwide and indicate MORB-like (3)He/(4)He ratios in OIBs cannot be used to preclude deep mantle-sourced hotspots.},

abstract = {Although the Moon currently has no internally generated magnetic field, palaeomagnetic data, combined with radiometric ages of Apollo samples, provide evidence for such a magnetic field from approximately 3.9 to 3.6 billion years (Gyr) ago, possibly owing to an ancient lunar dynamo. But the presence of a lunar dynamo during this time period is difficult to explain, because thermal evolution models for the Moon yield insufficient core heat flux to power a dynamo after approximately 4.2 Gyr ago. Here we show that a transient increase in core heat flux after an overturn of an initially stratified lunar mantle might explain the existence and timing of an early lunar dynamo. Using a three-dimensional spherical convection model, we show that a dense layer, enriched in radioactive elements (a 'thermal blanket'), at the base of the lunar mantle can initially prevent core cooling, thereby inhibiting core convection and magnetic field generation. Subsequent radioactive heating progressively increases the buoyancy of the thermal blanket, ultimately causing it to rise back into the mantle. The removal of the thermal blanket, proposed to explain the eruption of thorium- and titanium-rich lunar mare basalts, plausibly results in a core heat flux sufficient to power a short-lived lunar dynamo.},

abstract = {Lunar rocks contain a record of an ancient magnetic field that seems to have persisted for more than 400 million years and which has been attributed to a lunar dynamo. Models of conventional dynamos driven by thermal or compositional convection have had difficulty reproducing the existence and apparently long duration of the lunar dynamo. Here we investigate an alternative mechanism of dynamo generation: continuous mechanical stirring arising from the differential motion, due to Earth-driven precession of the lunar spin axis, between the solid silicate mantle and the liquid core beneath. We show that the fluid motions and the power required to drive a dynamo operating continuously for more than one billion years and generating a magnetic field that had an intensity of more than one microtesla 4.2 billion years ago are readily obtained by mechanical stirring. The magnetic field is predicted to decrease with time and to shut off naturally when the Moon recedes far enough from Earth that the dissipated power is insufficient to drive a dynamo; in our nominal model, this occurred at about 48 Earth radii (2.7 billion years ago). Thus, lunar palaeomagnetic measurements may be able to constrain the poorly known early orbital evolution of the Moon. This mechanism may also be applicable to dynamos in other bodies, such as large asteroids.},

abstract = {Measurements of Xe isotope ratios in ocean island basalts (OIB) suggest that Earth's mantle accreted heterogeneously, and that compositional remnants of accretion are sampled by modern, high-3He/4He OIB associated with the Icelandic and Samoan plumes. If so, the high-3He/4He source may also have a distinct oxygen isotopic composition from the rest of the mantle. Here, we test if the major elements of the high-3He/4He source preserve any evidence of heterogeneous accretion using measurements of three oxygen isotopes on olivine from a variety of high-3He/4He OIB locations. To high precision, the $\Delta$17O value of high-3He/4He olivines from Hawaii, Pitcairn, Baffin Island and Samoa, are indistinguishable from bulk mantle olivine ($\Delta$17OBulkMantle−$\Delta$17OHigh3He/4Heolivine=−0.002±0.004 (2×SEM)‰). Thus, there is no resolvable oxygen isotope evidence for heterogeneous accretion in the high-3He/4He source. Modelling of mixing processes indicates that if an early-forming, oxygen-isotope distinct mantle did exist, either the anomaly was extremely small, or the anomaly was homogenised away by later mantle convection. The $\delta$18O values of olivine with the highest 3He/4He ratios from a variety of OIB locations have a relatively uniform composition (∼5‰). This composition is intermediate to values associated with the depleted MORB mantle and the average mantle. Similarly, $\delta$18O values of olivine from high-3He/4He OIB correlate with radiogenic isotope ratios of He, Sr, and Nd. Combined, this suggests that magmatic oxygen is sourced from the same mantle as other, more incompatible elements and that the intermediate $\delta$18O value is a feature of the high-3He/4He mantle source. The processes responsible for the $\delta$18O signature of high-3He/4He mantle are not certain, but $\delta$18O–87Sr/86Sr correlations indicate that it may be connected to a predominance of a HIMU-like (high U/Pb) component or other moderate $\delta$18O components recycled into the high-3He/4He source.},

abstract = {Building the terrestrial planets has been a challenge for planet formation models. In particular, classical theories have been unable to reproduce the small mass of Mars and instead predict that a planet near 1.5 astronomical units (AU) should roughly be the same mass as Earth. Recently, a new model called Viscously Stirred Pebble Accretion (VSPA) has been developed that can explain the formation of the gas giants. This model envisions that the cores of the giant planets formed from 100- to 1,000-km bodies that directly accreted a population of pebbles-submeter-sized objects that slowly grew in the protoplanetary disk. Here we apply this model to the terrestrial planet region and find that it can reproduce the basic structure of the inner solar system, including a small Mars and a low-mass asteroid belt. Our models show that for an initial population of planetesimals with sizes similar to those of the main belt asteroids, VSPA becomes inefficient beyond ∼ 1.5 AU. As a result, Mars's growth is stunted, and nothing large in the asteroid belt can accumulate.},

abstract = {It is widely held that the first step in forming gas-giant planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, was the production of solid 'cores' each with a mass roughly ten times that of the Earth. Getting the cores to form before the solar nebula dissipates (in about one to ten million years; ref. 3) has been a major challenge for planet formation models. Recently models have emerged in which 'pebbles' (centimetre-to-metre-sized objects) are first concentrated by aerodynamic drag and then gravitationally collapse to form objects 100 to 1,000 kilometres in size. These 'planetesimals' can then efficiently accrete left-over pebbles and directly form the cores of giant planets. This model is known as 'pebble accretion'; theoretically, it can produce cores of ten Earth masses in only a few thousand years. Unfortunately, full simulations of this process show that, rather than creating a few such cores, it produces a population of hundreds of Earth-mass objects that are inconsistent with the structure of the Solar System. Here we report that this difficulty can be overcome if pebbles form slowly enough to allow the planetesimals to gravitationally interact with one another. In this situation, the largest planetesimals have time to scatter their smaller siblings out of the disk of pebbles, thereby stifling their growth. Our models show that, for a large and physically reasonable region of parameter space, this typically leads to the formation of one to four gas giants between 5 and 15 astronomical units from the Sun, in agreement with the observed structure of the Solar System.},

abstract = {Despite very high temperatures accompanying lunar origin, indigenous water in the form of OH has been unambiguously observed in Apollo samples in recent years. Such observations have prompted questions about the abundance and distribution of lunar hydrogen. Here, we investigate the related question of the origin of lunar H: is the hydrogen observed a remnant of a much larger initial inventory that was inherited from a “wet” Earth but partly depleted during the process of origin, or was primordial hydrogen quantitatively lost from the lunar material, with water being delivered to lunar reservoirs via subsequent impacts after the origins sequence? Motivated by recent results pointing to a limited extent of hydrogen escape from the gravity field of the Earth during lunar origin, we apply a newly developed thermodynamic model of liquid–vapor silicates to the proto-lunar disk to interrogate the behavior of H as a trace element in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact. We find that: (1) pre-existing H-bearing molecules are rapidly dissociated at the temperatures considered (3100–4200 K) and vaporized hydrogen predominantly exists as OH(v), H(v) and MgOH(v) for nearly the full range of thermal states encountered in the proto-lunar disk, (2) despite such a diversity in the vapor speciation – which reduces the water fugacity and favors hydrogen exsolution from co-existing liquids – the equilibration of the vapor atmosphere with the disk liquid results in significant dissolution of H into proto-lunar magmas, and (3) equilibrium H isotopic fractionation in this setting is limited to {\textless}10 per mil and the “terrestrial” character of lunar D/H recently inferred should extend to such a precision if liquid–vapor equilibration in the proto-lunar disk is the process that gave rise to lunar hydrogen. Taken together, these results implicate dissolution as the process responsible for establishing lunar H abundances.},

Tungsten isotopic data for Kostomuksha komatiites dated at 2.8 billion years ago show a well-resolved (182)W excess relative to modern terrestrial samples, whereas data for Komati komatiites dated at 3.5 billion years ago show no such excess. Combined (182)W, (186,187)Os, and (142,143)Nd isotopic data indicate that the mantle source of the Kostomuksha komatiites included material from a primordial reservoir that represents either a deep mantle region that underwent metal-silicate equilibration or a product of large-scale magmatic differentiation of the mantle. The preservation, until at least 2.8 billion years ago, of this reservoir-which likely formed within the first 30 million years of solar system history-indicates that the mantle may have never been well mixed.},

abstract = {We report new data for W concentrations, stable W isotopic compositions, high-precision 182W/184W ratios, highly siderophile element (HSE) abundances and 187Re–187Os systematics in a suite of 3.8–3.3Ga mafic and ultramafic rocks from the Isua supracrustal belt, and the Paleoarchean terrane in the northwestern part of the belt. These data are compared with published data for 146Sm–142Nd systematics in the same samples. The samples from the Isua supracrustal belt show well resolved excesses of 182W/184W of up to ∼21ppm, consistent with previous W isotopic data reported by Willbold et al. (2011). While there is abundant evidence that W was mobilized in the crust accessed by the Isua supracrustal suite, the isotopic anomalies are interpreted to primarily reflect processes that affected the mantle precursors to these rocks. The origin of the 182W excesses in these rocks remains uncertain. The Isua mantle source could represent a portion of the post-core-formation mantle that was isolated from late accretionary additions (e.g., Willbold et al., 2011). However, the combined 182W, Re–Os isotopic systematics and HSE abundances estimated for the source of the Isua basalts are difficult to reconcile with this interpretation. The W isotope variations were more likely produced as a result of fractionation of the Hf/W ratio in the mantle during the lifetime of 182Hf, i.e., during the first 50Ma of Solar System history. This could have occurred as a result of differentiation in an early magma ocean. The Isua suite examined is also characterized by variable 142Nd/144Nd, but the variations do not correlate with the variations in 182W/184W. Further, samples with ages between 3.8 and 3.3Ga show gradual diminution of 142Nd anomalies until these are no longer resolved from the modern mantle isotopic composition. By contrast, there is no diminishment of 182W variability with time, suggesting different mechanisms of origin and retention of isotopic variations for these two extinct-radionuclide isotope systems. The presence of 182W isotopic anomalies in rocks as young as 3.3Ga, implies that early-formed, high Hf/W domains survived for more than 1Ga in the convective mantle.},

@article{Rubie2011,
abstract = {A model of core formation is presented that involves the Earth accreting heterogeneously through a series of impacts with smaller differentiated bodies. Each collision results in the impactor's metallic core reacting with a magma ocean before merging with the Earth's proto-core. The bulk compositions of accreting planetesimals are represented by average solar system abundances of non-volatile elements (i.e. CI-chondritic), with 22{\%} enhancement of refractory elements and oxygen contents that are defined mainly by the Fe metal/FeO silicate ratio. Based on an anhydrous bulk chemistry, the compositions of coexisting core-forming metallic liquid and peridotitic silicate liquid are calculated by mass balance using experimentally-determined metal/silicate partition coefficients for the elements Fe, Si, O, Ni, Co, W, Nb, V, Ta and Cr. Oxygen fugacity is fixed by the partitioning of Fe between metal and silicate and depends on temperature, pressure and the oxygen content of the starting composition. Model parameters are determined by fitting the calculated mantle composition to the primitive mantle composition using least squares minimization. Models that involve homogeneous accretion or single-stage core formation do not provide acceptable fits. In the most successful models, involving 24 impacting bodies, the initial 60–70{\%} (by mass) of the Earth accretes from highly-reduced material with the final 30–40{\%} of accreted mass being more oxidised, which is consistent with results of dynamical accretion simulations. In order to obtain satisfactory fits for Ni, Co and W, it is required that the larger (and later) impactor cores fail to equilibrate completely before merging with the Earth's proto-core, as proposed previously on the basis of Hf-W isotopic studies. Estimated equilibration conditions may be consistent with magma oceans extending to the core–mantle boundary, thus making core formation extremely efficient. The model enables the compositional evolution of the Earth's mantle and core to be predicted throughout the course of accretion. The results are consistent with the late accretion of the Earth's water inventory, possibly with a late veneer after core formation was complete. Finally, the core is predicted to contain {\~{}} 5 wt.{\%} Ni, {\~{}} 8 wt.{\%} Si, {\~{}} 2 wt.{\%} S and {\~{}} 0.5 wt.{\%} O.},

Most of the trends reported earlier remain apparent in the expanded data set. In this paper I concentrate on the rotation statistics of the smallest asteroids, D {\textless} 10 km. The main conclusion is that there are no asteroids rotating fast enough that they are in a state of tension, that is, that they would fly apart if they had no tensile strength. In earlier studies, it was not clear whether this is because small asteroids indeed have no tensile strength, or only because such fast rotation is statistically improbable enough that one would not expect to find an end-member of the distribution spinning faster than that limit. A histogram of the spin distribution of the smallest asteroids of the present expanded data set indicates that the distribution at the fast end of rotation frequency is in fact truncated, thus implying that even these small asteroids have no tensile strength, that is, they are not monolithic, and may be "rubble piles."},

abstract = {Redox conditions in magma oceans (MOs) have a key influence on the mass and composition of Earth's early atmosphere. If the shallow part of the MO is oxidized, it may be overlain by an H2O–CO2 atmosphere, but if the near-surface magma is close to equilibrium with Fe-rich alloy, then the atmosphere will consist chiefly of H2, H2O, and CO, and on cooling will be rich in CH4. Although MOs are intimately associated with core-forming metal, the redox conditions in their shallow parts are not necessarily reducing. The magmatic Fe3+/FeT ratio is set by equilibrium with metal at depth and homogenized through the magma column by convection. Indirect evidence suggests that the Fe3+/FeT ratio of magmas in equilibrium with alloy at high pressure is greater than at low pressure, such that the shallow part of the MO may be comparatively oxidized and coexist with an atmosphere consisting chiefly of H2O and CO2. The mass of the atmosphere is dictated by the concentrations of volatile-species dissolved in the magma, which in turn are determined by partitioning between magma and alloy. Very strong partitioning of C into alloy may capture most of the carbon delivered to the growing planet, leaving behind a C-poor bulk silicate Earth (BSE) and a C-poor atmosphere. However, modest solubility of CH4 in the magma may allow the BSE to retain significant C. Alternatively, if partitioning of C into alloy is extreme but the fraction of metal equilibrated with the MO is small, the alloy may become saturated with diamond. Floatation of diamond in the MO may retain a substantial inventory of C in the early mantle. BSE C may also have been replenished in a late veneer. Following segregation of metal to the core, crystallization of the MO may have prompted precipitation of C-rich phases (graphite, diamond, carbide), limiting the C in the early atmosphere and creating a substantial interior C inventory that may account for the large fraction of BSE carbon in the mantle today. Such precipitation could have occurred owing to a combination of the redox evolution of the crystallizing MO and cooling.},

Guided by thermodynamics, all available metal-silicate partition coefficients, D(i), where i is Ni, Co, P, Mo and W, are regressed against 1T, PT, lnf(O2), ln(1 − Xs) (XS is mole fraction of S in metallic liquid) and nbo/t (non-bridging oxygen/tetrahedral cation ratio, a silicate melt compositional-structural parameter) to derive equations of the following form: ln D(i) = aln f(O2) + (bT) + (cPT) + d(nbot) + eln(1 − XS) + f. Expressions for solid metal-liquid silicate and liquid metal-liquid silicate partition coefficients are derived for S-free and S-bearing systems. We investigate whether Earth's upper-mantle siderophile element abundances can be reconciled with simple metal-silicate equilibrium. Sulfur-free metallic compositions do not allow a good fit. However, Ni, Co, Mo, W and P abundances in the upper mantle are consistent with simple metal-silicate equilibrium at mantle pressures and temperatures (27 GPa, 2200 K, $\Delta$IW(iron-w{\"{u}}stite) = −0.15, nbot = 2.7; XS = 0.15). Although these conditions are near the anhydrous peridotite solidus, they are well above the hydrous solidus and probably closer to the liquidus. A hydrous magma ocean and early mantle are consistent with predicted planetary accretion models. These results suggest that siderophile element abundances in Earth's upper mantle were established by liquid metal-liquid silicate equilibrium near the upper-mantle-lower-mantle boundary.},

abstract = {The compositional variations among the chondrites inform us about cosmochemical fractionation processes during condensation and aggregation of solid matter from the solar nebula. These fractionations include: (i) variable Mg-Si-RLE ratios (RLE: refractory lithophile element), (ii) depletions in elements more volatile than Mg, (iii) a cosmochemical metal-silicate fractionation, and (iv) variations in oxidation state. Moon- to Mars-sized planetary bodies, formed by rapid accretion of chondrite-like planetesimals in local feeding zones within 106 years, may exhibit some of these chemical variations. However, the next stage of planetary accretion is the growth of the terrestrial planets from approximately 102 embryos sourced across wide heliocentric distances, involving energetic collisions, in which material may be lost from a growing planet as well as gained. While this may result in averaging out of the 'chondritic' fractionations, it introduces two non-chondritic chemical fractionation processes: post-nebular volatilization and preferential collisional erosion. In the latter, geochemically enriched crust formed previously is preferentially lost. That post-nebular volatilization was widespread is demonstrated by the non-chondritic Mn/Na ratio in all the small, differentiated, rocky bodies for which we have basaltic samples, including the Moon and Mars. The bulk silicate Earth (BSE) has chondritic Mn/Na, but shows several other compositional features in its pattern of depletion of volatile elements suggestive of non-chondritic fractionation. The whole-Earth Fe/Mg ratio is 2.1+/-0.1, significantly greater than the solar ratio of 1.9+/-0.1, implying net collisional erosion of approximately 10 per cent silicate relative to metal during the Earth's accretion. If this collisional erosion preferentially removed differentiated crust, the assumption of chondritic ratios among all RLEs in the BSE would not be valid, with the BSE depleted in elements according to their geochemical incompatibility. In the extreme case, the Earth would only have half the chondritic abundances of the highly incompatible, heat-producing elements Th, U and K. Such an Earth model resolves several geochemical paradoxes: the depleted mantle occupies the whole mantle, is completely outgassed in (40)Ar and produces the observed (4)He flux through the ocean basins. But the lower radiogenic heat production exacerbates the discrepancy with heat loss.},

abstract = {We analyze previous results on the stability of uniformly and differentially rotating, self-gravitating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric systems to derive a new stability criterion for the appearance of toroidal, m=2 Intermediate (I) and bar modes. In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar systems and the m=2 I-modes in gaseous systems have many common physical characteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy of the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in stellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability criterion. The new stability parameter "alpha" is formulated first for uniformly rotating systems and is based on the angular momentum content rather than on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems "alpha" = 0.254-0.258, while it is in the range of 0.341-0.354 for gaseous systems. For uniform rotation, one can write "alpha" as a function of the total (rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is characteristic of the topology/connectedness and the geometric shape of a system. "Alpha" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of differentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal models whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known. We also estimate "alpha" for gaseous toroidal models and for stellar disk systems embedded in an inert or responsive "halo". We find that the new stability criterion holds equally well for all these previously published axisymmetric models.},

abstract = {Earth's core is structured in a solid inner core, mainly composed of iron, and a liquid outer core. The temperature at the inner core boundary is expected to be close to the melting point of iron at 330 gigapascal (GPa). Despite intensive experimental and theoretical efforts, there is little consensus on the melting behavior of iron at these extreme pressures and temperatures. We present static laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments up to 200 GPa using synchrotron-based fast x-ray diffraction as a primary melting diagnostic. When extrapolating to higher pressures, we conclude that the melting temperature of iron at the inner core boundary is 6230 ± 500 kelvin. This estimation favors a high heat flux at the core-mantle boundary with a possible partial melting of the mantle.},

Based on a reanalysis of the long-wavelength nonhydrostatic geoid, we infer viscous layering of the mantle using a method that allows us to avoid a priori assumptions about its variation with depth. We detect an increase in viscosity at 800- to 1200-kilometers depth, far greater than the depth of the mineral phase transformations that define the mantle transition zone. The viscosity increase is coincident in depth with regions where seismic tomography has imaged slab stagnation, plume deflection, and changes in large-scale structure and offers a simple explanation of these phenomena.},

abstract = {The earliest dynamic and thermal history of the Moon is not well understood. The hydrogen content of deposits near the lunar poles may yield insight into this history, because these deposits (which are probably composed of water ice) survive only if they remain in permanent shadow. If the orientation of the Moon has changed, then the locations of the shadowed regions will also have changed. The polar hydrogen deposits have been mapped by orbiting neutron spectrometers, and their observed spatial distribution does not match the expected distribution of water ice inferred from present-day lunar temperatures. This finding is in contrast to the distribution of volatiles observed in similar thermal environments at Mercury's poles. Here we show that polar hydrogen preserves evidence that the spin axis of the Moon has shifted: the hydrogen deposits are antipodal and displaced equally from each pole along opposite longitudes. From the direction and magnitude of the inferred reorientation, and from analysis of the moments of inertia of the Moon, we hypothesize that this change in the spin axis, known as true polar wander, was caused by a low-density thermal anomaly beneath the Procellarum region. Radiogenic heating within this region resulted in the bulk of lunar mare volcanism and altered the density structure of the Moon, changing its moments of inertia. This resulted in true polar wander consistent with the observed remnant polar hydrogen. This thermal anomaly still exists and, in part, controls the current orientation of the Moon. The Procellarum region was most geologically active early in lunar history, which implies that polar wander initiated billions of years ago and that a large portion of the measured polar hydrogen is ancient, recording early delivery of water to the inner Solar System. Our hypothesis provides an explanation for the antipodal distribution of lunar polar hydrogen, and connects polar volatiles to the geologic and geophysical evolution of the Moon and the bombardment history of the early Solar System.},

abstract = {The Tharsis region is the largest volcanic complex on Mars and in the Solar System. Young lava flows cover its surface (from the Amazonian period, less than 3 billion years ago) but its growth started during the Noachian era (more than 3.7 billion years ago). Its position has induced a reorientation of the planet with respect to its spin axis (true polar wander, TPW), which is responsible for the present equatorial position of the volcanic province. It has been suggested that the Tharsis load on the lithosphere influenced the orientation of the Noachian/Early Hesperian (more than 3.5 billion years ago) valley networks and therefore that most of the topography of Tharsis was completed before fluvial incision. Here we calculate the rotational figure of Mars (that is, its equilibrium shape) and its surface topography before Tharsis formed, when the spin axis of the planet was controlled by the difference in elevation between the northern and southern hemispheres (hemispheric dichotomy). We show that the observed directions of valley networks are also consistent with topographic gradients in this configuration and thus do not require the presence of the Tharsis load. Furthermore, the distribution of the valleys along a small circle tilted with respect to the equator is found to correspond to a southern-hemisphere latitudinal band in the pre-TPW geographical frame. Preferential accumulation of ice or water in a south tropical band is predicted by climate model simulations of early Mars applied to the pre-TPW topography. A late growth of Tharsis, contemporaneous with valley incision, has several implications for the early geological history of Mars, including the existence of glacial environments near the locations of the pre-TPW poles of rotation, and a possible link between volcanic outgassing from Tharsis and the stability of liquid water at the surface of Mars.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, observations of giant exoplanets (Jupiter-size) have provided key insights into their atmospheres, but the properties of lower-mass exoplanets (sub-Neptune) remain largely unconstrained because of the challenges of observing small planets. Numerous efforts to observe the spectra of super-Earths-exoplanets with masses of one to ten times that of Earth-have so far revealed only featureless spectra. Here we report a longitudinal thermal brightness map of the nearby transiting super-Earth 55 Cancri e (refs 4, 5) revealing highly asymmetric dayside thermal emission and a strong day-night temperature contrast. Dedicated space-based monitoring of the planet in the infrared revealed a modulation of the thermal flux as 55 Cancri e revolves around its star in a tidally locked configuration. These observations reveal a hot spot that is located 41 ± 12 degrees east of the substellar point (the point at which incident light from the star is perpendicular to the surface of the planet). From the orbital phase curve, we also constrain the nightside brightness temperature of the planet to 1,380 ± 400 kelvin and the temperature of the warmest hemisphere (centred on the hot spot) to be about 1,300 kelvin hotter (2,700 ± 270 kelvin) at a wavelength of 4.5 micrometres, which indicates inefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. Our observations are consistent with either an optically thick atmosphere with heat recirculation confined to the planetary dayside, or a planet devoid of atmosphere with low-viscosity magma flows at the surface.},

abstract = {The terrestrial planets and the asteroids dominant in the inner asteroid belt are water poor. However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have decreased below water-condensation level well before the disk was photo-evaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is puzzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be direct condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the Sun more slowly than the gas itself. Thus the gas in the vicinity of the snowline always comes from farther out, where it should have already condensed, and therefore it should be dry. The appearance of ice in a range of heliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial drift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a planet with a mass larger than 20 Earth mass is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because such a planet gives the disk a super-Keplerian rotation just outside of its own orbit. From this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved this threshold mass when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively fossilized the snowline at that location. In fact, even if it cooled later, the disk inside of Jupiter's orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from the outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that planetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in their inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the planetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to explain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its orbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of the phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus, when the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7AU without being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing planetesimals.},

abstract = {Plumes of hot upwelling rock rooted in the deep mantle have been proposed as a possible origin of hotspot volcanoes, but this idea is the subject of vigorous debate. On the basis of geodynamic computations, plumes of purely thermal origin should comprise thin tails, only several hundred kilometres wide, and be difficult to detect using standard seismic tomography techniques. Here we describe the use of a whole-mantle seismic imaging technique--combining accurate wavefield computations with information contained in whole seismic waveforms--that reveals the presence of broad (not thin), quasi-vertical conduits beneath many prominent hotspots. These conduits extend from the core-mantle boundary to about 1,000 kilometres below Earth's surface, where some are deflected horizontally, as though entrained into more vigorous upper-mantle circulation. At the base of the mantle, these conduits are rooted in patches of greatly reduced shear velocity that, in the case of Hawaii, Iceland and Samoa, correspond to the locations of known large ultralow-velocity zones. This correspondence clearly establishes a continuous connection between such zones and mantle plumes. We also show that the imaged conduits are robustly broader than classical thermal plume tails, suggesting that they are long-lived, and may have a thermochemical origin. Their vertical orientation suggests very sluggish background circulation below depths of 1,000 kilometres. Our results should provide constraints on studies of viscosity layering of Earth's mantle and guide further research into thermochemical convection.},

abstract = {The fate of surface water on Venus is one of the most important outstanding problems in comparative planetology. Although Venus should have had a large amount of surface water (like the Earth) during its formation, the current water content on the Venusian surface is only 1 part in 100 000 of that of the mass of Earth's oceans. Here a new concept is proposed to explain water removal on a steam-covered proto Venus, referred to as “impact-driven planetary desiccation”. Since a steam atmosphere is photochemically unstable, water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. Then, hydrogen escapes easily into space through hydrodynamic escape driven by strong extreme ultraviolet radiation from the young Sun. The focus is on the intense impact bombardment during the terminal stage of planetary accretion as generators of a significant amount of reducing agent. The fine-grained ejecta remove the residual oxygen, the counter part of escaped hydrogen, via the oxidation of iron-bearing rocks in a hot atmosphere. Thus, hypervelocity impacts cause net desiccation of the planetary surface. I constructed a stochastic cratering model using a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the cumulative mass of nonoxidized, ejected rocks due to the intense impact bombardment. The ejecta mass after each impact was calculated using the $\pi$-group scaling laws and a modified Maxwell's Z model. The effect of projectile penetration into the ground on the ejecta mass was also included. Next, an upper limit on the total amount of removed water was calculated using the stoichiometric limit of the oxidation of basaltic rocks, taking into account the effect of fast H2 escape. It is shown that a thick steam atmosphere with a mass equivalent to that of the terrestrial oceans would be removed. The cumulative mass of rocky ejecta released into the atmosphere reaches 1 wt{\%} of the host planet, which is 10 000 times of the current mass of the Earth's atmosphere. These results strongly suggest that chemical reactions between such large amounts of ejecta and planetary atmospheres are among the key factors required to understand atmospheric mass and its composition, not only in the Solar System but also in extrasolar systems.},

Chromium isotope ratios ($\delta$53Cr) for mare basalts are positively correlated with indices of magmatic differentiation such as Mg{\#} and Cr concentration which suggests that Cr isotopes were fractionated during magmatic differentiation. Modelling of the results provides evidence that spinel and pyroxene are the main phases controlling the Cr isotopic composition during fractional crystallisation. The most evolved samples have the lightest isotopic compositions, complemented by cumulates that are isotopically heavy. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this fractionation: (i) equilibrium fractionation where heavy isotopes are preferentially incorporated into the spinel lattice and (ii) a difference in isotopic composition between Cr2+ and Cr3+ in the melt. However, both processes require magmatic temperatures below 1200°C for appreciable Cr3+ to be present at the low oxygen fugacities found in the Moon (IW −1 to −2 log units). There is no isotopic difference between the most primitive high-Ti, low-Ti and KREEP basalts, which suggest that the sources of these basalts were homogeneous in terms of stable Cr isotopes. The least differentiated sample in our sample set is the low-Ti basalt 12016, characterised by a Cr isotopic composition of −0.222±0.025‰, which is within error of the current BSE value (−0.124±0.101‰). The similarity between the mantles of the Moon and Earth is consistent with a terrestrial origin for a major fraction of the lunar Cr. This similarity also suggests that Cr isotopes were not fractionated by core formation on the Moon.},

abstract = {High precision Sm−Nd isotopic analyses have been completed on a suite of 11 martian basaltic meteorites in order to better constrain the age of silicate differentiation on Mars associated with the formation of their mantle sources. These data are used to evaluate the merits and disadvantages of various mathematical approaches that have been employed in previous work on this topic. Ages determined from the Sm−Nd isotopic systematics of individual samples are strongly dependent on the assumed Nd isotopic composition of the bulk planet. This assumption is problematic given differences observed between the Nd isotopic composition of Earth and chondritic meteorites and the fact that these materials are both commonly used to represent bulk planetary Nd isotopic compositions. Ages determined from the slope of 146Sm−142Nd whole rock isochrons are not dependent on the assumed 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the planet, but require the sample suite to be derived from complementary, contemporaneously-formed reservoirs. In this work, we present a mathematical expression that defines the age of formation of the source regions of such a suite of samples that is based solely on the slope of a 143Nd−142Nd whole rock isochron and is also independent of any a priori assumptions regarding the bulk isotopic composition of the planet. This expression is also applicable to mineral isochrons and has been used to successfully calculate 143Nd−142Nd model crystallization ages of early refractory solids as well as lunar samples. This permits ages to be obtained using only Nd isotopic measurements without the need for 147Sm/144Nd isotope dilution determinations. When used in conjunction with high-precision Nd isotopic measurements completed on martian meteorites this expression yields an age of formation of the martian basaltic meteorite source regions of 4504±6Ma. Because the Sm−Nd model ages for the formation of martian source regions are commonly interpreted to record the age at which large scale mantle reservoirs formed during planetary differentiation associated with magma ocean solidification, the age determined here implies that magma ocean solidification occurred several tens of millions of years after the beginning of the Solar System. Recent thermal models, however, suggest that Mars-sized bodies cool rapidly in less than ∼5Ma after accretion ceases, even in the presence of a thick atmosphere. Assuming these models are correct, an extended period of accretion is necessary to provide a mechanism to keep portions of the martian mantle partially molten until 4504Ma. Late accretional heating of Mars could either be associated with protracted accretion occurring at a quasi-steady state or alternatively be associated with a late giant impact. If this scenario is correct, then accretion of Mars-sized bodies takes up to 60Ma and is likely to be contemporaneous with the core formation and possibly the onset of silicate differentiation. This further challenges the concept that isotopic equilibrium is attained during primordial evolution of planets, and may help to account for geochemical evidence implying addition of material into planetary interiors after core formation was completed.},

abstract = {Low estimated lunar volatile contents, compared with Earth, are a fundamental observation for Earth-Moon system formation and lunar evolution. Here we present zinc isotope and abundance data for lunar crustal rocks to constrain the abundance of volatiles during the final stages of lunar differentiation. We find that ferroan anorthosites are isotopically heterogeneous, with some samples exhibiting high $\delta$(66)Zn, along with alkali and magnesian suite samples. Since the plutonic samples were formed in the lunar crust, they were not subjected to degassing into vacuum. Instead, their compositions are consistent with enrichment of the silicate portions of the Moon in the heavier Zn isotopes. Because of the difference in $\delta$(66)Zn between bulk silicate Earth and lunar basalts and crustal rocks, the volatile loss likely occurred in two stages: during the proto-lunar disk stage, where a fraction of lunar volatiles accreted onto Earth, and from degassing of a differentiating lunar magma ocean, implying the possibility of isolated, volatile-rich regions in the Moon's interior.},

abstract = {A comparison of compressional properties of silicate solids, glasses, and liquids reveals the following fundamental differences: (1) Liquids have much smaller bulk moduli than solids and glasses and the bulk moduli of various silicate melts have a narrow range of values; (2) Liquids do not follow the Birch's law of corresponding state as opposed to solids and glasses; (3) The Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter increases with increasing pressure for liquids but decreases for solids; (4) The radial distribution functions of liquids show that the interatomic distances in liquids do not change upon compression as much as solids do. The last observation indicates that the compression of silicate melts occurs mostly through the geometrical arrangement of various units whose sizes do not change much with compression, i.e., the entropic mechanism of compression plays a dominant role over the internal energy contribution. All of the other three observations listed above can be explained by this point of view. In order to account for the role of the entropic contribution, we propose a new equation of state for multi-component silicate melts based on the hard sphere mixture model of a liquid. We assign a hard sphere for each cation species that moves in the liquid freely except for the volume occupied by other spheres. The geometrical arrangement of these spheres gives the entropic contribution to compression, while the Columbic attraction between all ions provides the internal energy contribution to compression. We calibrate the equation of state using the experimental data on room-pressure density and room-pressure bulk modulus of liquids. The effective size of a hard sphere for each component in silicate melts is determined. The temperature and volume dependencies of sphere diameters are also included in the model in order to explain the experimental data especially the melt density data at high pressures. All compressional properties of a silicate melt can be calculated using the calibrated sphere diameters. This equation of state provides a unified explanation for most of compressional behaviors of silicate melts and the experimental observations cited above including the uniformly small bulk moduli of silicate melts as well as the pressure dependence of Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameters. With additional data to better constrain the key parameters, this equation of state will serve as a first step toward the unified equation of state for silicate melts.},

abstract = {We develop a new model to understand and predict the behavior of oxide and silicate melts at extreme temperatures and pressures, including deep mantle conditions like those in the early Earth magma ocean. The Coordinated Hard Sphere Mixture (CHaSM) is based on an extension of the hard sphere mixture model, accounting for the range of coordination states available to each cation in the liquid. By utilizing approximate analytic expressions for the hard sphere model, this method is capable of predicting complex liquid structure and thermodynamics while remaining computationally efficient, requiring only minutes of calculation time on standard desktop computers. This modeling framework is applied to the MgO system, where model parameters are trained on a collection of crystal polymorphs, producing realistic predictions of coordination evolution and the equation of state of MgO melt over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. We find that the typical coordination number of the Mg cation evolves continuously upward from 5.25 at 0GPa to 8.5 at 250GPa. The results produced by CHaSM are evaluated by comparison with predictions from published first-principles molecular dynamics calculations, indicating that CHaSM is accurately capturing the dominant physics controlling the behavior of oxide melts at high pressure. Finally, we present a simple quantitative model to explain the universality of the increasing Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter trend for liquids, which directly reflects their progressive evolution toward more compact solid-like structures upon compression. This general behavior is opposite that of solid materials, and produces steep adiabatic thermal profiles for silicate melts, thus playing a crucial role in magma ocean evolution.},

abstract = {Iapetus has preserved evidence that constrains the modeling of its geophysical history from the time of its accretion until now. The evidence is (a) its present 79.33-day rotation or spin rate, (b) its shape that corresponds to the equilibrium figure for a hydrostatic body rotating with a period of ∼16 h, and (c) its high, equatorial ridge, which is unique in the Solar System. This paper reports the results of an investigation into the coupling between Iapetus' thermal and orbital evolution for a wide range of conditions including the spatial distributions with time of composition, porosity, short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRI), and temperature. The thermal model uses conductive heat transfer with temperature-dependent conductivity. Only models with a thick lithosphere and an interior viscosity in the range of about the water ice melting point can explain the observed shape. Short-lived radioactive isotopes provide the heat needed to decrease porosity in Iapetus' early history. This increases thermal conductivity and allows the development of the strong lithosphere that is required to preserve the 16-h rotational shape and the high vertical relief of the topography. Long-lived radioactive isotopes and SLRI raise internal temperatures high enough that significant tidal dissipation can start, and despin Iapetus to synchronous rotation. This occurred several hundred million years after Iapetus formed. The models also constrain the time when Iapetus formed because the successful models are critically dependent upon having just the right amount of heat added by SLRI decay in this early period. The amount of heat available from short-lived radioactivity is not a free parameter but is fixed by the time when Iapetus accreted, by the canonical concentration of 26Al, and, to a lesser extent, by the concentration of 60Fe. The needed amount of heat is available only if Iapetus accreted between 2.5 and 5.0 Myr after the formation of the calcium aluminum inclusions as found in meteorites. Models with these features allow us to explain Iapetus' present synchronous rotation, its fossil 16-h shape, and the context within which the equatorial ridge arose.},

abstract = {We revisit the appropriate energies to be used for computing heat production from 26Al decay. Due to the complexity of the decay scheme of this radioisotope, previous geophysical studies have used values ranging from 1.2 to 4MeV per decay. The upper bound corresponds to the difference in mass energy between the 26Al and 26Mg ground states. This includes energy carried away by neutrinos, which does not contribute to heating planetary material. The lower bound does not account for the heating caused by the absorption of the $\gamma$ rays from the excited 26Mg, or for the annihilation energy deposited in the material if the decay occurs inside even small planetesimals. Based on the calculations described by Schramm et al. [Schramm, D., Tera, F., Wasserburg, G.J., 1970. The isotopic abundance of 26Mg and limits on 26Al in the early Solar System. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 10, 44–59] updated with the most recent nuclear constants, we recommend using a heat production value of 3.12MeV per decay, which is the total energy of disintegration minus the energy carried off by the neutrinos.

abstract = {Chondritic meteorites are unmelted and variably metamorphosed aggregates of the earliest solids of the solar system. The variety of metamorphic textures in chondrites motivated the “onion shell” model in which chondrites originated at varying depths within a parent body heated primarily by the short-lived radioisotope 26Al, with the highest metamorphic grade originating nearest the center. Allende and a few other chondrites possess a unidirectional magnetization that can be best explained by a core dynamo on their parent body, indicating internal melting and differentiation. Here we show that a parent body that accreted to {\textgreater}{\~{}}200km in radius by {\~{}}1.5Ma after the formation of calcium–aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) would have a differentiated interior, and ongoing accretion would add a solid undifferentiated crust overlying a differentiated interior, consistent with formational and evolutionary constraints inferred for the CV parent body. This body could have produced a magnetic field lasting more than 10Ma. This hypothesis represents a new model for the origin of some chondrites, presenting them as the unprocessed crusts of internally differentiated early planetesimals. Such bodies may exist in the asteroid belt today; the shapes and masses of the two largest asteroids, 1 Ceres and 2 Pallas, can be consistent with differentiated interiors, conceivably with small iron cores with hydrated silicate or ice–silicate mantles, covered with undifferentiated crusts.},

abstract = {Impacts between planetesimals have largely been ruled out as a heat source in the early Solar System, by calculations that show them to be an inefficient heat source and unlikely to cause global heating. However, the long-term, localized thermal effects of impacts on planetesimals have never been fully quantified. Here, we simulate a range of impact scenarios between planetesimals to determine the post-impact thermal histories of the parent bodies, and hence the importance of impact heating in the thermal evolution of planetesimals. We find on a local scale that heating material to petrologic type 6 is achievable for a range of impact velocities and initial porosities, and impact melting is possible in porous material at a velocity of {\textgreater}4km/s. Burial of heated impactor material beneath the impact crater is common, insulating that material and allowing the parent body to retain the heat for extended periods (∼millions of years). Cooling rates at 773K are typically 1–1000K/Ma, matching a wide range of measurements of metallographic cooling rates from chondritic materials. While the heating presented here is localized to the impact site, multiple impacts over the lifetime of a parent body are likely to have occurred. Moreover, as most meteorite samples are on the centimeter to meter scale, the localized effects of impact heating cannot be ignored.},

abstract = {The isotopes (129)Xe, produced from the radioactive decay of extinct (129)I, and (136)Xe, produced from extinct (244)Pu and extant (238)U, have provided important constraints on early mantle outgassing and volatile loss from Earth. The low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic xenon ((129)Xe/(130)Xe) in ocean island basalts (OIBs) compared with mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs) have been used as evidence for the existence of a relatively undegassed primitive deep-mantle reservoir. However, the low (129)Xe/(130)Xe ratios in OIBs have also been attributed to mixing between subducted atmospheric Xe and MORB Xe, which obviates the need for a less degassed deep-mantle reservoir. Here I present new noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) measurements from an Icelandic OIB that reveal differences in elemental abundances and (20)Ne/(22)Ne ratios between the Iceland mantle plume and the MORB source. These observations show that the lower (129)Xe/(130)Xe ratios in OIBs are due to a lower I/Xe ratio in the OIB mantle source and cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric Xe with MORB-type Xe. Because (129)I became extinct about 100 million years after the formation of the Solar System, OIB and MORB mantle sources must have differentiated by 4.45 billion years ago and subsequent mixing must have been limited. The Iceland plume source also has a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe, requiring the plume source to be less degassed than MORBs, a conclusion that is independent of noble gas concentrations and the partitioning behaviour of the noble gases with respect to their radiogenic parents. Overall, these results show that Earth's mantle accreted volatiles from at least two separate sources and that neither the Moon-forming impact nor 4.45 billion years of mantle convection has erased the signature of Earth's heterogeneous accretion and early differentiation.},

abstract = {We investigate the origin and loss of captured hydrogen envelopes from protoplanets having masses in a range between sub-Earth'-like bodies of 0.1 M{\{}oplus{\}} and super-Earths' with 5 M{\{}oplus{\}} in the habitable zone at 1 au of a Sun-like G star, assuming that their rocky cores had formed before the nebula gas dissipated. We model the gravitational attraction and accumulation of nebula gas around a planet's core as a function of protoplanetary luminosity during accretion and calculate the resulting surface temperature by solving the hydrostatic structure equations for the protoplanetary nebula. Depending on nebular properties, such as the dust grain depletion factor, planetesimal accretion rates, and resulting luminosities, for planetary bodies of 0.1-1 M{\{}oplus{\}} we obtain hydrogen envelopes with masses between [{\~{}}]2.5 {\{}nun{\}}1019 and 1.5 {\{}nun{\}}1026 g. For super-Earths' with masses between 2 and 5 M{\{}oplus{\}} more massive hydrogen envelopes within the mass range of [{\~{}}]7.5 {\{}nun{\}}1023-1.5 {\{}nun{\}}1028 g can be captured from the nebula. For studying the escape of these accumulated hydrogen-dominated protoatmospheres, we apply a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model and calculate the loss rates due to the heating by the high soft-X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux of the young Sun/star. The results of our study indicate that under most nebula conditions sub-Earth' and Earth-mass planets can lose their captured hydrogen envelopes by thermal escape during the first [{\~{}}]100 Myr after the disc dissipated. However, if a nebula has a low dust depletion factor or low accretion rates resulting in low protoplanetary luminosities, it is possible that even protoplanets with Earth-mass cores may keep their hydrogen envelopes during their whole lifetime. In contrast to lower mass protoplanets, more massive super-Earths', which can accumulate a huge amount of nebula gas, lose only tiny fractions of their primordial hydrogen envelopes. Our results agree with the fact that Venus, Earth, and Mars are not surrounded by dense hydrogen envelopes, as well as with the recent discoveries of low density super-Earths' that most likely could not get rid of their dense protoatmospheres.},

@article{Righter2016,
abstract = {To better understand and predict the partition coefficient of Mo at the conditions of the deep interior of Earth and other terrestrial planets or bodies, we have undertaken new measurements of the valence and partitioning of Mo. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) K-edge spectra for Mo have been measured in a series of Fe-bearing glasses produced at 1 bar and higher PT conditions. High pressure experiments have been carried out up to 19 GPa in order to better understand the effect of pressure on Mo partitioning. And, finally, a series of experiments at very low fO2 conditions and high Si content metallic liquids has been carried out to constrain the effect of Si on the partitioning of Mo between metallic liquids and silicate melt. The valence measurements demonstrate that Mo undergoes a transition from 4+ to 6+ near IW−1, in general agreement with previous 1 bar studies on FeO-free silicate melts. High pressure experiments demonstrate a modest pressure dependence of D(Mo) metal/silicate and, combined with previous results, show a significant decrease with pressure that must be quantified in any predictive expression. Finally, the effect of dissolved Si in Fe-rich metallic liquid is to decrease D(Mo) significantly, as suggested by previous work in metallurgical systems. The effect of pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity, metallic liquid composition, and silicate melt composition can be quantified by using multiple linear regression of available experimental data for Mo. Our XANES results show that Mo will be 4+ at conditions of core formation, so only experiments carried out at fO2 of IW−1 and lower were used in the regressions. Application of predictive expressions to Earth accretion shows that D(Mo) decreases to values consistent with an equilibrium scenario for early Earth core–mantle. The Mo content of the primitive upper mantle (PUM) can be attained by metal–silicate equilibrium involving S-, C-, and Si-bearing metallic liquid, and peridotite silicate melt along the peridotite liquidus near 45 GPa and 3600 °C, late in the accretion process. This conclusion is insensitive to late giant impacts unless the degree of equilibration is very low ({\textless}5{\%}).},

@article{Aharonson2012,
abstract = {Numerical simulations and analysis show that the Moon locks into resonance with a statistical preference of facing either the current near-side or far-side toward Earth. The near-side is largely covered by dense, topographically low, dark mare basalts, the pattern of which to some, resembles the image of a man's face. Although the Moon is locked in this configuration at present, the opposite one, with the current far-side facing Earth, is of lower potential energy and hence might be naively expected. Instead, we find that the probability of selecting each configuration depends upon the ratio of the asymmetry of the potential energy maxima, dominated by the octupole moment of the Moon, to the energy dissipated per tidal cycle within the Moon. If this ratio is small, the two configurations are equally likely. Otherwise, interesting dynamical behavior ensues. In the Moon's present orbit, with the best-estimated geophysical parameters and dissipation parameter Q=35, trapping into the current higher-energy configuration is preferred. With Q=100 in analogy with the solid Earth, the current configuration is nearly certain. The ratio of energies and corresponding probabilities were different in the past. Relative crater counts on the leading and trailing faces indicate an impact may have unlocked the Moon before it settled into the present configuration. Our analysis constrains the geophysical parameters at the time of the last such event.},

However, the most accessible reservoir, Earth's oceans, may no longer represent the original (primordial) D/H ratio, owing to changes caused by water cycling between the surface and the interior. Thus, a reservoir completely isolated from surface processes is required to define Earth's original D/H signature. Here we present data for Baffin Island and Icelandic lavas, which suggest that the deep mantle has a low D/H ratio ($\delta$D more negative than -218 per mil). Such strongly negative values indicate the existence of a component within Earth's interior that inherited its D/H ratio directly from the protosolar nebula.},

abstract = {Recent high-precision isotopic measurements show that the isotopic similarity of Earth and Moon is unique among all known planetary bodies in our Solar System. These observations provide fundamental constraints on the origin of Earth–Moon system, likely a catastrophic Giant Impact event. However, in contrast to the isotopic composition of many elements (e.g., O, Mg, Si, K, Ti, Cr, and W), the Fe isotopic compositions of all lunar samples are significantly different from those of the bulk silicate Earth. Such a global Fe isotopic difference between the Moon and Earth provides an important constraint on the lunar formation – such as the amount of Fe evaporation as a result of a Giant Impact origin of the Moon. Here, we show through high-precision Fe isotopic measurements of one of the oldest lunar rocks (4.51±0.10 Gyr dunite 72 415), compared with Fe isotope results of other lunar samples from the Apollo program, and lunar meteorites, that the lunar dunite is enriched in light Fe isotopes, complementing the heavy Fe isotope enrichment in other lunar samples. Thus, the earliest olivine accumulation in the Lunar Magma Ocean may have been enriched in light Fe isotopes. This new observation allows the Fe isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Moon to be identical to that of the bulk silicate Earth, by balancing light Fe in the deep Moon with heavy Fe in the shallow Moon rather than the Moon having a heavier Fe isotope composition than Earth as a result of Giant Impact vaporization.},

abstract = {Early in the Solar System's history, energetic collisions of differentiated bodies affected the final composition of the terrestrial planets through partial destruction. Enstatite chondrites (EC) are the best candidates to represent the primordial terrestrial precursors as they present the most similar isotopic compositions to Earth. Here we report that collisional erosion of {\textgreater}15{\%} of the early Earth's mass can reconcile the remaining compositional differences between EC and the Earth. We base our demonstration on experimental melting of an EC composition at pressures between 1 bar and 25 GPa. At low pressures, the first silicate melts are highly enriched in incompatible elements Si, Al and Na, and depleted in Mg. Loss of proto-crusts through impacts raises the Earth's Mg/Si ratio to its present value. To match all major element compositions, our model implies preferential loss of volatile lithophile elements and re-condensation of refractory lithophile elements after the impacts.},

abstract = {The so-called theory of figures (TOF) uses potential theory to solve for the structure of highly distorted rotating liquid planets in hydrostatic equilibrium. An apparently divergent expansion for the gravitational potential plays a fundamental role in the traditional TOF. This questionable expansion, when integrated, leads to the standard geophysical expansion of the external gravitational potential on spherical-harmonics (via the usual J-coefficients). We show that this expansion is convergent and exact on the planet's level surfaces, provided that rotational distortion does not exceed a critical value. We examine the general properties of the Maclaurin multipole expansion and discuss conditions for its convergence on the surface of both single and nested-concentric Maclaurin spheroids.},

abstract = {By comparison with the Earth-like planets and the large icy satellites of the Solar System, one can model the internal structure of extrasolar planets. The input parameters are the composition of the star (Fe/Si and Mg/Si), the Mg content of the mantle (Mg{\#}=Mg/[Mg+Fe]), the amount of H2O and the total mass of the planet. Equation of State (EoS) of the different materials that are likely to be present within such planets have been obtained thanks to recent progress in high-pressure experiments. They are used to compute the planetary radius as a function of the total mass. Based on accretion models and data on planetary differentiation, the internal structure is likely to consist of an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle and an outer silicate crust resulting from magma formation in the mantle. The amount of H2O and the surface temperature control the possibility for these planets to harbor an ocean. In preparation to the interpretation of the forthcoming data from the CNES led CoRoT (Convection Rotation and Transit) mission and from ground-based observations, this paper investigates the relationship between radius and mass. If H2O is not an important component (less than 0.1{\%}) of the total mass of the planet, then a relation (R/REarth)=a(M/MEarth)b is calculated with (a,b)=(1,0.306) and (a,b)=(1,0.274) for 10−2MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}MEarth and MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}10MEarth, respectively. Calculations for a planet that contains 50{\%} H2O suggest that the radius would be more than 25{\%} larger than that based on the Earth-like model, with (a,b)=(1.258,0.302) for 10−2MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}MEarth and (a,b)=(1.262,0.275) for MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}10MEarth, respectively. For a surface temperature of 300 K, the thickness of the ocean varies from 150 to 50 km for planets 1 to 10 times the Earth's mass, respectively. Application of this algorithm to bodies of the Solar System provides not only a good fit to most terrestrial planets and large icy satellites, but also insights for discussing future observations of exoplanets.},

abstract = {The Earth's Moon is thought to have formed by an impact between the Earth and an impactor around 4.5 billion years ago. This impact could have been so energetic that it could have mixed and homogenized the Earth's mantle. However, this view appears to be inconsistent with geochemical studies that suggest that the Earth's mantle was not mixed by the impact. Another outcome of the impact is that this energetic impact melted the whole mantle, but the extent of mantle melting is not well understood even though it must have had a significant effect on the subsequent evolution of the Earth's interior and atmosphere. To understand the initial state of the Earth's mantle, we perform giant impact simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for three different models: (a) standard: a Mars-sized impactor hits the proto-Earth, (b) fast-spinning Earth: a small impactor hits a rapidly rotating proto-Earth, and (c) sub-Earths: two half Earth-sized planets collide. We use two types of equations of state (MgSiO3 liquid and forsterite) to describe the Earth's mantle. We find that the mantle remains unmixed in (a), but it may be mixed in (b) and (c). The extent of mixing is most extensive in (c). Therefore, (a) is most consistent and (c) may be least consistent with the preservation of the mantle heterogeneity, while (b) may fall between. We determine that the Earth's mantle becomes mostly molten by the impact in all of the models. The choice of the equation of state does not affect these outcomes. Additionally, our results indicate that entropy gains of the mantle materials by a giant impact cannot be predicted well by the Rankine–Hugoniot equations. Moreover, we show that the mantle can remain unmixed on a Moon-forming timescale if it does not become mixed by the impact.},

abstract = {The seismic determinations of the crustal thickness and mantle velocities are key parameters for most geophysical and geochemical lunar studies. We determine a new seismic model of the Moon after a complete independent reprocessing of the Apollo lunar seismic data with determination of arrival times of about 60 natural and artificial lunar quakes, as well as travel times of converted phases at the crust–mantle interface below the Apollo 12 landing site. On the near side in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane, the only major discontinuity compatible with the crust–mantle boundary is located around 30 km deep. In this terrane, seismic constraints on the crust and mantle lead to a 30 km thick anorthositic crust and a pyroxenite cold mantle, with a bulk composition of 6.4{\%} Al2O3, 4.9{\%} CaO and 13.3{\%} FeO. Mantle temperatures are in accordance with profiles obtained from the observed electrical conductivity and exclude a liquid Fe core, while being compatible with a Fe–S liquid core. Our Moon model might be explained by a mixture of a primitive Earth with tholeiitic crust and depleted upper mantle, together with a chondritic enstatitic parent body for the impactor planet. It provides mixture coefficients comparable to those obtained by impact simulation as well as an estimate of bulk U of about 28 ppb, in accordance with the U budget in a 40 km mean thick crust, 700 km thick depleted mantle and a lower undepleted primitive mantle.},

abstract = {Recent geochemical and geophysical data from the Moon enable a revision of earlier interpretations regarding lunar origin, structure and bulk composition. Earth and Moon show many similarities among their isotopic compositions, but they have evolved in totally dissimilar ways, probably related to the deficiency of water in the Moon as well as the vast differences in size and internal pressure. Although some global geochemical trends such as volatile depletion based on K/U ratios have been established, current lunar samples come from differentiated regions, making the establishment of a bulk composition more reliant on bulk geophysical properties or isotopic similarities although it remains unclear how the latter relate to whole Moon composition. The lack of fractionation effects among the refractory and super-refractory elements indicates that the proto-lunar material seems unlikely to have been vaporized while the depletion of volatile elements may place lower limits on proto-lunar temperatures. The apparent lack of geochemical evidence of an impacting body enables other possible impactors, such as comets, to be considered.},

abstract = {A great number of element correlations have been observed in lunar samples. It is known from theoretical and experimental studies that in the solar nebula the elements condensed in groups according to their condensation temperatures and chemical affinities. One of these groups - the refractory elements - is represented by the early condensates or high temperature condensates (h.t.c.). From element correlations and group relations we estimate the bulk Moon to contain about 50{\%} of h.t.c.; the other 50{\%}, the non-refractory portion, consists mainly of (Mg, Fe)-silicates and minor phases of about chondritic composition. Recently we have found strong evidence that most of the lunar highland samples represent mechanical mixtures of a differentiated (feldspathic) lunar component and a primary component from the last accretion stage of the Moon. The contribution of the h.t.c. in this primary material is estimated to 21{\%}. Hence, an inhomogeneous accretion of the Moon is indicated. After the formation of a highly refractory core relatively more and more non-refractory material was added until the Moon reached its final mass. The composition of the primary matter observed in the lunar highlands gives us an important clue to the composition of the non-refractory portion of the Moon and thus leads to a more reliable estimation of the lunar bulk composition.},

@article{Morbidelli2015,
abstract = {The basic structure of the solar system is set by the presence of low-mass terrestrial planets in its inner part and giant planets in its outer part. This is the result of the formation of a system of multiple embryos with approximately the mass of Mars in the inner disk and of a few multi-Earth-mass cores in the outer disk, within the lifetime of the gaseous component of the protoplanetary disk. What was the origin of this dichotomy in the mass distribution of embryos/cores? We show in this paper that the classic processes of runaway and oligarchic growth from a disk of planetesimals cannot explain this dichotomy, even if the original surface density of solids increased at the snowline. Instead, the accretion of drifting pebbles by embryos and cores can explain the dichotomy, provided that some assumptions hold true. We propose that the mass-flow of pebbles is two-times lower and the characteristic size of the pebbles is approximately ten times smaller within the snowline than beyond the snowline (respectively at heliocentric distance r{\textless}rice and r{\textgreater}rice, where rice is the snowline heliocentric distance), due to ice sublimation and the splitting of icy pebbles into a collection of chondrule-size silicate grains. In this case, objects of original sub-lunar mass would grow at drastically different rates in the two regions of the disk. Within the snowline these bodies would reach approximately the mass of Mars while beyond the snowline they would grow to ∼20 Earth masses. The results may change quantitatively with changes to the assumed parameters, but the establishment of a clear dichotomy in the mass distribution of protoplanets appears robust provided that there is enough turbulence in the disk to prevent the sedimentation of the silicate grains into a very thin layer.},

abstract = {We present conclusions from a large number of N-body simulations of the giant impact phase of terrestrial planet formation. We focus on new results obtained from the recently proposed Grand Tack model, which couples the gas-driven migration of giant planets to the accretion of the terrestrial planets. The giant impact phase follows the oligarchic growth phase, which builds a bi-modal mass distribution within the disc of embryos and planetesimals. By varying the ratio of the total mass in the embryo population to the total mass in the planetesimal population and the mass of the individual embryos, we explore how different disc conditions control the final planets. The total mass ratio of embryos to planetesimals controls the timing of the last giant (Moon-forming) impact and its violence. The initial embryo mass sets the size of the lunar impactor and the growth rate of Mars. After comparing our simulated outcomes with the actual orbits of the terrestrial planets (angular momentum deficit, mass concentration) and taking into account independent geochemical constraints on the mass accreted by the Earth after the Moon-forming event and on the time scale for the growth of Mars, we conclude that the protoplanetary disc at the beginning of the giant impact phase must have had most of its mass in Mars-sized embryos and only a small fraction of the total disc mass in the planetesimal population. From this, we infer that the Moon-forming event occurred between approximately 60 and approximately 130 Myr after the formation of the first solids and was caused most likely by an object with a mass similar to that of Mars.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of debris created in the giant impacts expected during the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. The starting point is the debris created in a simulation of the Moon-forming impact. The dynamical evolution is followed for 10 Myr including the effects of Earth, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The spatial distribution evolves from a clump in the first few months to an asymmetric ring for the first 10 kyr and finally becoming an axisymmetric ring by about 1 Myr after the impact. By 10 Myr after the impact 20 per cent of the particles have been accreted on to Earth and 17 per cent on to Venus, with 8 per cent ejected by Jupiter and other bodies playing minor roles. However, the fate of the debris also depends strongly on how fast it is collisionally depleted, which depends on the poorly constrained size distribution of the impact debris. Assuming that the debris is made up of 30 per cent by mass mm-cm-sized vapour condensates and 70 per cent boulders up to 500 km, we find that the condensates deplete rapidly on [{\~{}}]1000 yr time-scales, whereas the boulders deplete predominantly dynamically. By considering the luminosity of dust produced in collisions within the boulder-debris distribution we find that the Moon-forming impact would have been readily detectable around other stars in Spitzer 24 m surveys for around 25 Myr after the impact, with levels of emission comparable to many known hot dust systems. The vapour condensates meanwhile produce a short-lived, optically thick, spike of emission. We use these surveys to make an estimate of the fraction of stars that form terrestrial planets, FTPF.

abstract = {Past discussions of core formation are incorrect or incomplete because they assume that metallic iron-rich liquid is able to migrate through a mostly solid silicate matrix by percolation, prior to macrosegregation and diapiric descent. Experimental and theoretical considerations suggest that percolation is largely prevented because of the high surface tension of iron. Two alternative views of core formation are offered. One assumes that percolation is possible in the deep mantle. Iron is then supplied to the deep mantle by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities of a silicate-iron suspension in the shallow mantle, and drains efficiently from the deepest mantle into the core by Darcy flow. The other model assumes complete or nearly complete melting of all or part of the mantle. Despite vigorous convection, iron droplets approximately one centimeter in radius are predicted and settle rapidly by Stokes flow, either to the core or into a layer or ponds that provide iron-rich diapirs that can descend to the core. These stories generally suggest very efficient core formation in the sense that the typical residence time of metallic iron in the mantle is orders of magnitude shorter than the formation time of Earth (≡108years). The tentative inference of rapid core formation on Mars suggests a magma ocean and iron rainout.},

In order to aid in the physical interpretation of these radii, we compute model radii for low-mass rocky planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We provide model radii for planets 1-20 M ⊕, with envelope fractions 0.01{\%}-20{\%}, levels of irradiation 0.1-1000 times Earth's, and ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide simple analytic fits that summarize how radius depends on each of these parameters. Most importantly, we show that at fixed H/He envelope fraction, radii show little dependence on mass for planets with more than {\~{}}1{\%} of their mass in their envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to a first order a proxy for planetary composition, i.e., H/He envelope fraction, for Neptune- and sub-Neptune-sized planets. We recast the observed mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship and discuss it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the transition from rocky super-Earths to sub-Neptune planets with large volatile envelopes. We suggest {\~{}}1.75 R ⊕ as a physically motivated dividing line between these two populations of planets.

abstract = {The isotopic similarity of the Earth and Moon has motivated a recent investigation of the formation of the Moon with a fast-spinning Earth (Cuk, M., Stewart, S.T., [2012]. Science, doi:10.1126/science.1225542). Angular momentum was found to be drained from the system through a resonance between the Moon and Sun. They found a narrow range of parameters that gave results consistent with the current angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. However, a tidal model was used that was described as approximating a constant Q tidal model, but it was not a constant Q model. Here we use a conventional constant Q tidal model to explore the process. We find that there is still a narrow range of parameters in which angular momentum is withdrawn from the system that corresponds roughly to the range found earlier, but the final angular momentum is too low to be consistent with the Earth–Moon system. Exploring a broader range of parameters we find a new phenomenon, not found in the earlier work, that extracts angular momentum from the Earth–Moon system over a broader range of parameters. The final angular momentum is more consistent with the actual angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. We develop a simple model that exhibits the phenomenon.},

abstract = {We present angular momentum transport (torque) measurements in two recent experimental studies of the turbulent flow between independently rotating cylinders. In addition to these studies, we reanalyze prior torque measurements to expand the range of control parameters for the experimental Taylor-Couette flows. We find that the torque may be described as a product of functions that depend only on the Reynolds number, which describes the turbulent driving intensity, and the rotation number, which characterizes the effects of global rotation. For a given Reynolds number, the global angular momentum transport for Keplerian-like flow profiles is approximately 14{\%} of the maximum achievable transport rate. We estimate that this level of transport would produce an accretion rate of Ṁ/Ṁ0{\~{}}10-3 in astrophysical disks. We argue that this level of transport from hydrodynamics alone could be significant. We also discuss the possible role of finite-size effects in triggering or sustaining turbulence in our laboratory experiments.},

The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X = 0.7491), helium (Y = 0.2377), and heavy elements (Z = 0.0133), leading to Z/X = 0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X = 0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0 = 0.7110, Y0 = 0.2741, and Z0 = 0.0149. The solar system and photospheric abundance tables are used to compute self-consistent sets of condensation temperatures for all elements.},

When combined with remote sensing and sample data, this density implies an average crustal porosity of 12{\%} to depths of at least a few kilometers. Lateral variations in crustal porosity correlate with the largest impact basins, whereas lateral variations in crustal density correlate with crustal composition. The low-bulk crustal density allows construction of a global crustal thickness model that satisfies the Apollo seismic constraints, and with an average crustal thickness between 34 and 43 kilometers, the bulk refractory element composition of the Moon is not required to be enriched with respect to that of Earth.},

abstract = {We used ICP-MS to measure the elemental concentrations and isotopic abundances of Cu and Zn in: nine Ti-rich lunar basalts (10017, 10022, 10024, 10057, 70215, 71055, 74255, 75055, and 75075); size-separated samples prepared by sieving of pyroclastic black glass 74001, orange glass 74022, and the lunar soils 15021, 15231, 70181, and 79221; a basalt from the Piton des Neiges volcano, Reunion Island; two samples of Pele's hairs from the Nyiragongo volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the martian meteorite Zagami. The isotopic fractionation of zinc in lunar basalts and Zagami is mass dependent relative to a terrestrial standard (JMC 400882B). These and published results imply that lunar, terrestrial, meteoritic, and perhaps martian zinc all come from one or more reservoirs linked by mass-dependent fractionation processes. Relative to terrestrial basalts, Ti-rich lunar basalts are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Cu and Zn: we find for Ti-rich lunar basalts the following ranges and averages ±1 - $\sigma$ (‰): $\delta$65Cu/63Cu ≡ $\delta$65Cu, 0.1-1.4, 0.5 ± 0.1‰ (N = 7); $\delta$66Zn/64Zn ≡ $\delta$66Zn = 0.2-1.9, 1.2 ± 0.2‰ (N = 8; 10017 excluded). For two terrestrial samples, we find $\delta$66Zn ∼ +0.3‰ and $\delta$65Cu ∼ 0‰, which are consistent with published values. The differences between the lunar basalts and terrestrial basalts could reflect minor, planetary-scale vaporization or igneous processes on the Moon. Data for size separates of the pyroclastic glasses 74001 and 74220 confirm the well-known surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but modeling calculations reveal no sharp differences between either the elemental ratios or the isotopic composition of grain interiors and exteriors. The absence of such differences indicates that the isotopic compositions for bulk samples are dominated by a light-isotope-rich surface component. Data for size separates of lunar soils also confirm the surface correlation of Cu and Zn, but an enrichment of heavy rather than light isotopes. Averages for bulk lunar soils from this work and the literature are (‰): $\delta$65Cu, from 1.4 to 4.1, average 3.0 ± 0.3 (N = 9); $\delta$66Zn, from 2.2 to 6.4, average 4.0 ± 0.3 (N = 14). As with the glasses, in all but soil 15231 our data show no strong differences between the isotopic composition of soil sub-samples with small and large grains. The size of the isotopic fractionation inferred for the surface component in the soils is 3× smaller than predicted by a published model of sputtering primarily by solar particles. At the same time, the observed fractionation is larger than predicted by calculations based on a model of micrometeorite impact heating and hydrodynamic quenching. Because impact heating appears unable to explain the observations, we conclude that sputtering must be important even though samples with very large isotopic fractionation of Cu and Zn have not yet been found. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

@article{Hallis2010,
abstract = {To investigate the formation and early evolution of the lunar mantle and crust we have analysed the oxygen isotopic composition, titanium content and modal mineralogy of a suite of lunar basalts. Our sample set included eight low-Ti basalts from the Apollo 12 and 15 collections, and 12 high-Ti basalts from Apollo 11 and 17 collections. In addition, we have determined the oxygen isotopic composition of an Apollo 15 KREEP (K - potassium, REE - Rare Earth Element, and P - phosphorus) basalt (sample 15386) and an Apollo 14 feldspathic mare basalt (sample 14053). Our data display a continuum in bulk-rock $\delta$18O values, from relatively low values in the most Ti-rich samples to higher values in the Ti-poor samples, with the Apollo 11 sample suite partially bridging the gap. Calculation of bulk-rock $\delta$18O values, using a combination of previously published oxygen isotope data on mineral separates from lunar basalts, and modal mineralogy (determined in this study), match with the measured bulk-rock $\delta$18O values. This demonstrates that differences in mineral modal assemblage produce differences in mare basalt $\delta$18O bulk-rock values. Differences between the low- and high-Ti mare basalts appear to be largely a reflection of mantle-source heterogeneities, and in particular, the highly variable distribution of ilmenite within the lunar mantle. Bulk $\delta$18O variation in mare basalts is also controlled by fractional crystallisation of a few key mineral phases. Thus, ilmenite fractionation is important in the case of high-Ti Apollo 17 samples, whereas olivine plays a more dominant role for the low-Ti Apollo 12 samples.Consistent with the results of previous studies, our data reveal no detectable difference between the $\Delta$17O of the Earth and Moon. The fact that oxygen three-isotope studies have been unable to detect a measurable difference at such high precisions reinforces doubts about the giant impact hypothesis as presently formulated. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {We report new high-precision laser fluorination three-isotope oxygen data for lunar materials. Terrestrial silicates with a range of $\delta$ 18O values (- 0.5 to 22.9‰) were analyzed to independently determine the slope of the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL; $\lambda$ = 0.5259 ± 0.0008; 95{\%} confidence level). This new TFL determination allows direct comparison of lunar oxygen isotope systematics with those of Earth. Values of $\Delta$ 17O for Apollo 12, 15, and 17 basalts and Luna 24 soil samples average 0.01‰ and are indistinguishable from the TFL. The $\delta$ 18O values of high- and low-Ti lunar basalts are distinct. Average whole-rock $\delta$ 18O values for low-Ti lunar basalts from the Apollo 12 (5.72 ± 0.06‰) and Apollo 15 landing sites (5.65 ± 0.12‰) are identical within error and are markedly higher than Apollo 17 high-Ti basalts (5.46 ± 0.11‰). Evolved low-Ti LaPaz mare-basalt meteorite $\delta$ 18O values (5.67 ± 0.05‰) are in close agreement with more primitive low-Ti Apollo 12 and 15 mare basalts. Modeling of lunar mare-basalt source composition indicates that the high- and low-Ti mare-basalt mantle reservoirs were in oxygen isotope equilibrium and that variations in $\delta$ 18O do not result from fractional crystallization. Instead, these differences are consistent with mineralogically heterogeneous mantle sources for mare basalts, and with lunar magma ocean differentiation models that result in a thick feldspathic crust, an olivine-pyroxene-rich mantle, and late-stage ilmenite-rich zones that were convectively mixed into deeper portions of the lunar mantle. Higher average $\delta$ 18O (WR) values of low-Ti basalts compared to terrestrial mid ocean ridge basalts ($\Delta$=0.18‰) suggest a possible oxygen isotopic difference between the terrestrial and lunar mantles. However, calculations of the $\delta$ 18O of lunar mantle olivine in this study are only 0.05‰ higher than terrestrial mantle olivine. These observations may have important implications for understanding the formation of the Earth-Moon system. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study presents comprehensive strontium stable isotope ( 88Sr/ 86Sr) data, measured by multiple-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), for a suite of carbonaceous chondrites, differentiated meteorites, lunar, martian and terrestrial samples.Carbonaceous chondrites comprise a mixture of refractory inclusions and chondrules that have light $\delta$ 88Sr values between -0.35 to +0.05{\%} and matrix material that possesses a heavy $\delta$ 88Sr composition of 0.65{\%}, confirming the results of earlier studies. Consequently, bulk carbonaceous chondrites are relatively heterogeneous in composition ranging from +0.12 to +0.35{\%}, most likely reflecting clast-matrix variability. The light $\delta$ 88Sr compositions of the refractory inclusions are consistent with mass dependent fractionation of other refractory elements (Ca and Eu) and are most likely produced by non-equilibrium fractionation (undercooling in the nebula gas) during condensation of hibonite from the solar nebula (Simon and DePaolo, 2010. Stable calcium isotopic composition of meteorites and rocky planets. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 289, 457-466).Carbonaceous chondrites, angrites and martian meteorites have indistinguishable compositions at the level of analytical uncertainty of this study. However, statistical analysis indicates that melts derived from the Earth's mantle have heavier $\delta$ 88Sr values than bulk carbonaceous chondrites and martian meteorites, but compositions indistinguishable from eucrites ($\delta$ 88Sr=+0.26±0.12{\%}). Moreover, terrestrial basalts and andesites have restricted $\delta$ 88Sr values (+0.30±0.07{\%}), suggesting that mantle melting delivers rather homogenous melts to the Earth's surface with respect to $\delta$ 88Sr.In contrast, glasses from evolved terrestrial rocks and lunar basalts extend to very light $\delta$ 88Sr values {\~{}}-0.20{\%}. The Sr stable isotope composition covaries with europium anomaly (Eu/Eu*), as an index of plagioclase fractionation, and $\delta$ 88Sr can be successfully modelled by the heavy isotopes of Sr being preferentially partitioned into plagioclase with a fractionation factor of {\~{}}1.0007 for 88Sr/ 86Sr. Our results demonstrate that Sr stable isotopes may be significantly fractionated at high temperatures and their measurement can provide insights into planetary evolution and magmatic processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Oxygen and iron isotope analyses of low-Ti and high-Ti mare basalts are presented to constrain their petrogenesis and to assess stable isotope variations within lunar mantle sources. An internally-consistent dataset of oxygen isotope compositions of mare basalts encompasses five types of low-Ti basalts from the Apollo 12 and 15 missions and eight types of high-Ti basalts from the Apollo 11 and 17 missions. High-precision whole-rock $\delta$18O values (referenced to VSMOW) of low-Ti and high-Ti basalts correlate with major-element compositions (Mg{\#}, TiO2, Al2O3). The observed oxygen isotope variations within low-Ti and high-Ti basalts are consistent with crystal fractionation and match the results of mass-balance models assuming equilibrium crystallization. Whole-rock $\delta$56Fe values (referenced to IRMM-014) of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts range from 0.134‰ to 0.217‰ and 0.038‰ to 0.104‰, respectively. Iron isotope compositions of both low-Ti and high-Ti basalts do not correlate with indices of crystal fractionation, possibly owing to small mineral-melt iron fractionation factors anticipated under lunar reducing conditions.The $\delta$18O and $\delta$56Fe values of low-Ti and the least differentiated high-Ti mare basalts are negatively correlated, which reflects their different mantle source characteristics (e.g., the presence or absence of ilmenite). The average $\delta$56Fe values of low-Ti basalts (0.073±0.018‰, n=8) and high-Ti basalts (0.191±0.020‰, n=7) may directly record that of their parent mantle sources. Oxygen isotope compositions of mantle sources of low-Ti and high-Ti basalts are calculated using existing models of lunar magma ocean crystallization and mixing, the estimated equilibrium mantle olivine $\delta$18O value, and equilibrium oxygen-fractionation between olivine and other mineral phases. The differences between the calculated whole-rock $\delta$18O values for source regions, 5.57‰ for low-Ti and 5.30‰ for high-Ti mare basalt mantle source regions, are solely a function of the assumed source mineralogy. The oxygen and iron isotope compositions of lunar upper mantle can be approximated using these mantle source values. The $\delta$18O and $\delta$56Fe values of the lunar upper mantle are estimated to be 5.5±0.2‰ (2$\sigma$) and 0.085±0.040‰ (2$\sigma$), respectively. The oxygen isotope composition of lunar upper mantle is identical to the current estimate of Earth's upper mantle (5.5±0.2‰), and the iron isotope composition of the lunar upper mantle overlaps within uncertainty of estimates for the terrestrial upper mantle (0.044±0.030‰). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present the analytical methods that have been developed for the first high-precision Fe isotope analyses that clearly identify naturally-occurring, mass-dependent isotope fractionation. A double-spike approach is used, which allows rigorous correction of instrumental mass fractionation. Based on 21 analyses of an ultra pure Fe standard, the external precision (1-SD) for measuring the isotopic composition of Fe is ±0.14 ‰/mass; for demonstrated reproducibility on samples, this precision exceeds by at least an order of magnitude that of previous attempts to empirically control instrumentally-produced mass fractionation (Dixon et al., 1993). Using the double-spike method, 15 terrestrial igneous rocks that range in composition from peridotite to rhyolite, 5 high-Ti lunar basalts, 5 Fe-Mn nodules, and a banded iron formation have been analyzed for their iron isotopic composition. The terrestrial and lunar igneous rocks have the same isotopic compositions as the ultra pure Fe standard, providing a reference Fe isotope composition for the Earth and Moon. In contrast, Fe-Mn nodules and a sample of a banded iron formation have iron isotope compositions that vary over a relatively wide range, from $\delta$56Fe = +0.9 to -1.2 ‰; this range is 15 times the analytical errors of our technique. These natural isotopic fractionations are interpreted to reflect biological ('vital') effects, and illustrate the great potential Fe isotope studies have for studying modern and ancient biological processes.},

abstract = {We report high-precision MC-ICPMS measurements of 25Mg/ 24Mg and 26Mg/ 24Mg isotope ratios for 14 meteorites, both primitive and differentiated, 5 lunar basalts and breccia samples, 5 terrestrial basalts, 1 dunite and 3 peridotites. We estimate the $\delta$ 26Mg value of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) at -0.54±0.04 (2SE) w.r.t. DSM3. Carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites show an average $\delta$ 26Mg of -0.52±0.04 (2SE), martian meteorites show a narrow range in $\delta$ 26Mg with an average $\delta$ 26Mg of -0.57±0.02 (2SE), average $\delta$ 26Mg of pallasite olivines is -0.54±0.04 (2SE) whereas that of lunar samples, including ilmenite basalts, olivine basalt and one crystalline breccia is -0.51±0.03 (2SE). Our data demonstrate that the overall stable Mg isotopic composition of the inner Solar System (average $\delta$ 25Mg=-0.273, $\delta$ 26Mg=-0.535) is homogeneous to within ±0.04{\%} for 26Mg/ 24Mg. This value is indistinguishable from that of the BSE and lunar samples demonstrating that the Mg isotopic composition of the Earth-Moon system is chondritic. Accurate determination of the Mg isotopic composition of the rocky planets is important for Mg isotope studies of surface processes on Earth as well as for using Mg isotope data to understand evaporation and condensation effects in the solar nebula.Consistent with a recent report we find that clinopyroxenes have higher $\delta$ 26Mg than co-existing olivines and orthopyroxenes in mantle peridotites, although the magnitude of this difference varies (0.08 to 0.2{\%}). Such small mineral fractionations along with differences between components in primitive meteorites (CAIs, chondrules, and matrix) preclude the resolution of mass-dependent fractionation differences smaller than about 0.05{\%} between Solar System objects. We demonstrate that our results do not support the recent claims that: (i) the Earth-Moon system has a unique Mg isotope composition different from chondrites, or (ii) the higher $\delta$ 26Mg values (up to 0.0) reported for chondrites, achondrites, terrestrial basalts and peridotites. To address the issue of inter-laboratory discrepancies on the Mg isotopic composition of silicate rocks, we have prepared 3 pure Mg standards with wide ranging $\delta$ 26Mg (-3.75 to -0.69 with respect to DSM3) as well as a large volume of homogenized olivine from the San Carlos peridotite, which will be available to the scientific community, for future comparative studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Isotopic anomalies in Mo and Zr have recently been reported for bulk chondrites and iron meteorites and have been interpreted in terms of a primordial nucleosynthetic heterogeneity in the solar nebula. We report precise Zr isotopic measurements of carbonaceous, ordinary and enstatite chondrites, eucrites, mesosiderites and lunar rocks. All bulk rock samples yield isotopic compositions that are identical to the terrestrial standard within the analytical uncertainty. No anomalies in 92Zr are found in any samples including high Nb/Zr eucrites and high and low Nb/Zr calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs). These data are consistent with the most recent estimates of {\textless}10-4 for the initial 92Nb/93Nb of the solar system. There exists a trace of isotopic heterogeneity in the form of a small excess of r-process 96Zr in some refractory CAIs and some metal-rich phases of Renazzo. A more striking enrichment in 96Zr is found in acetic acid leachates of the Allende CV carbonaceous chondrite. These data indicate that the r- and s-process Zr components found in presolar grains were well mixed on a large scale prior to planetary accretion. However, some CAIs formed before mixing was complete, such that they were able to sample a population of r-process-enriched material. The maximum amount of additional r-process component that was added to the otherwise well-mixed Zr in the molecular cloud or disk corresponds to ∼0.01{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth and in chondrites and is a pure lithophile element which does not partition into planetary cores. Therefore, the calcium isotopic composition of the mantle represents the bulk Earth and calcium isotopes have the potential to reveal genetic links between Earth and meteorites. However, whether calcium exhibits significant mass-dependent variations among Earth and the various chondrite groups, and the magnitude of these variations, is still contentious. Here we have developed a new method to analyze calcium isotope ratios with high precision using multiple-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry. The method has been applied to a range of terrestrial and meteoritic samples. We find that the Earth, the Moon, and the aubrite parent body are indistinguishable from enstatite, ordinary, and CO chondritic meteorites. Therefore, enstatite chondrites cannot be excluded as components of Earth's building blocks based on calcium isotopes, as has been proposed previously. In contrast, CI, CV, CM and CR carbonaceous chondrites are largely enriched in lighter calcium isotopes compared to Earth, and, overall, exhibit a wide range in calcium isotopic composition. Calcium is the only major element, along with oxygen, for which isotopic variations are observed among carbonaceous chondrite groups. These calcium isotope variations cannot be attributed to volatility effects, and it is difficult to ascribe them to the abundance of isotopically light refractory inclusions. The calcium isotope data presented in this study suggest that both ordinary and enstatite chondrites are representative of the bulk of the refractory materials that formed Earth. On the basis of calcium isotopes, carbonaceous chondrites (with the exception of CO) are not representative of the fraction of condensable material that accreted to form the terrestrial planets and can be excluded as unique contenders for the building blocks of Earth; however, on the basis of other isotopic systems, CO chondrites can be excluded as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We report Si isotopic data on a suite of terrestrial mantle-derived samples, meteorites and a lunar sample. Our data on co-existing mantle minerals, peridotites and basalts demonstrate lack of any resolvable high temperature fractionation during igneous processes. We show that the $\delta$ 30Si of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is identical, within analytical uncertainties, to carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites (CHUR). Based on our data the difference between $\delta$ 30Si BSE and $\delta$ 30Si CHUR is 0.035±0.035. Whole-rock differentiated meteorites from different parent bodies (Mars, Vesta) and a lunar breccia sample also show similar $\delta$ 30Si suggesting broad-scale Si isotope homogeneity in the inner Solar System with an average $\delta$ 29Si=-0.20±0.01 and $\delta$ 30Si=-0.39±0.02 relative to the NBS28 Si isotope standard.A difference between $\delta$ 30Si BSE and $\delta$ 30Si CHUR of 0.035, as observed in our study, translates to less than 1.67wt.{\%} Si in the core considering a continuous accretion model whereas estimates using a batch model are even lower. Within uncertainties (±0.035‰) in the $\delta$ 30Si difference between the BSE and CHUR, a maximum of 3.84wt.{\%} Si could be present in the Earth's core whereas at $\delta$ 30Si BSE-$\delta$ 30Si CHUR=0, there is no requirement of Si in the Earth's core. Such low Si in the core necessitates the presence of other light elements in the core to explain its density deficit. Our data also places constraints on the oxidation state of the Earth's mantle during core segregation. The uncertainties in estimating the concentration of oxidized Fe in the mantle during the first 90{\%} of accretion arise from uncertainties in the estimates of the equilibrium partition coefficient of silicon between metal and silicate at conditions relevant to core formation. For $\delta$ 30Si BSE-$\delta$ 30Si CHUR=0.035±0.035, the concentration of oxidized Fe in the mantle during the first 90{\%} of accretion could be as low as {\~{}}1{\%}. However, at $\delta$ 30Si BSE-$\delta$ 30Si CHUR=0, the Si isotope data do not require any change in the mantle concentration of oxidized Fe during accretion from the present day value of 6.26{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Silicon isotopic data from a range of lunar samples are presented to assess the degree of heterogeneity of the lunar mantle and its similarity to bulk silicate Earth (BSE). Multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) was used to analyse 24 samples, including both high and low-Ti basalts, as well as Highland anorthosites and picritic glasses, covering all the Apollo sample return missions. No systematic $\delta$ 30Si differences are found between any of the bulk sample lithologies (±2$\sigma$ SD) ($\delta$ 30Si Low-Ti basalt=-0.29±0.06, $\delta$ 30Si High-Ti basalt=-0.32±0.09, $\delta$ 30Si lunar glass=-0.29±0.05 and $\delta$ 30Si Highland rocks=-0.27±0.10). The average of the lunar samples is $\delta$ 30Si=-0.29±0.08 (2$\sigma$ SD), which is identical to the composition of BSE, $\delta$ 30Si=-0.29±0.08 (2$\sigma$ SD), from Savage et al. (2010). The BSE Si isotope composition is thought to be the result of Si partitioning between metal and silicate, and consequent isotopic fractionation during core formation. The Moon-forming impactor would not be expected to share that composition, because it is thought to have been relatively small ({\~{}}0.1 Earth masses) like Mars and formed under relatively low temperatures and pressures that are insufficient for Si to partition into the core. Therefore, the identical lunar and BSE Si isotope data show that Si isotopes, like those of oxygen, must have homogenised in the aftermath of the Moon-forming impact, if smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations of the Giant Impact are correct in showing that most lunar material should have originated from the impactor rather than the Earth. The data presented here are in agreement with other isotope systems and experimental studies that indicate that the majority of core formation happened early and before the Giant Impact. It has been predicted (Pahlevan et al., 2011) that the Moon and the BSE should show a {\~{}}0.14‰ offset in $\delta$ 30Si for the Moon to have an Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratio twice that of BSE. The current resolution and sample population size of the Si data for the Moon and Earth would allow such an offset to be detected. The fact that is it not observed can put constraints on the element ratios and lunar budgets as modelled by Pahlevan et al. (2011); in particular, it constrains the Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratio of the Moon to be only 1-1.3 BSE. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Geochemical data for H2O and other volatiles, as well as major and trace elements, are reported for 377 samples of lunar volcanic glass from three chemical groups (A15 green, A15 yellow, A17 orange 74 220). These data demonstrate that degassing is a pervasive process that has affected all extrusive lunar rocks. The data are combined with published data to estimate the total composition of the bulk silicate Moon (BSM). The estimated BSM composition for highly volatile elements, constrained by H2O/Ce ratios and S contents in melt inclusions from orange glass sample 74 220, are only moderately depleted compared with the bulk silicate Earth (avg. 0.25X BSE) and essentially overlap the composition of the terrestrial depleted MORB source. In a single giant impact origin for the Moon, the Moon-forming material experiences three stages of evolution characterized by very different timescales. Impact mass ejection and proto-lunar disk evolution both permit system loss of H2O and other volatiles on timescales ranging from days to centuries; the early Moon is likely to have accreted from a thin magma disk of limited volume embedded in, but largely displaced from, the extended distribution of vapor around the Earth. Only the protracted evolution of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) presents a time window sufficiently long (10–200 Ma) for the Moon to gain water during the tail end of accretion. This “hot start” to lunar formation is however not the only model that matches the lunar volatile abundances; a “cold start” in which the proto-lunar disk is largely composed of solid material could result in efficient delivery of terrestrial water to the Moon, while a “warm start” producing a disk of 25{\%} volatile-retentive solids and 75{\%} volatile-depleted magma/vapor is also consistent with the data. At the same time, there exists little evidence that the Moon formed in a singular event, as all detailed planetary accretion models predict several giant impacts in the terrestrial planet region in which the Earth forms. It is thus conceivable that the Moon, like the Earth, experienced a history of heterogeneous accretion.},

abstract = {The most efficient energy sources known in the Universe are accretion disks. Those around black holes convert 5-40 per cent of rest-mass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid. The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability. Cool disks, such as the planet-forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows (for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet-forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial. Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non-magnetic quasi-keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements.

abstract = {Turbulent flow is a most important branch of fluid dynamics yet its complexity has tended to make it one of the least understood. Empirical data have been appearing rapidly for more than twenty years but a consistent theory of turbulent flow based on the results has been lacking. The original edition of Dr Townsend's book was the first to attempt a systematic and comprehensive discussion of all kinds of turbulent motion and to provide a reliable analysis of the processes which occur. The theory and associated concepts are applied to the description of a variety of flows: free turbulent flows such as wakes and jets, wall flows in pipes and boundary layers, flows affected by buoyancy forces such as heat plumes and the atmospheric boundary layer and flows with curved streamlines. This monograph will appeal to practitioners and researchers in engineering, meteorology, oceanography, physics and applied mathematics. This paperback edition was first issued in hard covers in 1976 as a complete revision, taking into account developments since 1955, of the first edition. It will be useful as an advanced text in applied mathematics, and the other disciplines mentioned above.},

abstract = {The Galileo and Cassini spacecrafts have greatly enhanced the observational record of Jupiter's tropospheric dynamics, particularly through returning high spatial resolution, multi-spectral and global imaging data with episodic coverage over periods of months to years. These data, along with those from Earth-based telescopes, have revealed the stability of Jupiter's zonal jets, captured the evolution of vortices and equatorial waves, and mapped the distributions of lightning and moist convection. Because no observations of Jupiter's interior exist, a forward modelling approach has been used to relate observations at cloud level to models of shallow or deep jet structure, shallow or deep jet forcing and energy transfer between turbulence, vortices and jets. A range of observed phenomena can be reproduced in shallow models, though the Galileo probe winds and jet stability arguments hint at the presence of deep jets. Many deep models, however, fail to reproduce Jupiter-like non-zonal features (e.g. vortices). Jupiter's dynamics likely include both deep and shallow processes, requiring an integrated approach to future modelling—an important goal for the post- Galileo and Cassini era.},

We reanalyzed Apollo lunar seismograms using array-processing methods to search for the presence of reflected and converted seismic energy from the core. Our results suggest the presence of a solid inner and fluid outer core, overlain by a partially molten boundary layer. The relative sizes of the inner and outer core suggest that the core is {\~{}}60{\%} liquid by volume.

abstract = {The deep structure of the Moon is a missing piece to understand the formation and evolution of the Earth–Moon system. Despite the great amount of information brought by the Apollo passive seismic experiment (ALSEP), the lunar structure below deep moonquakes, which occur around 900km depth, remains largely unknown. We construct a reference Moon model which incorporates physical constraints, and fits both geodesic (lunar mass and polar moment of inertia, and Love numbers) and seismological (body wave arrivals measured by Apollo network) data. In this model, the core radius is constrained by the detection of S waves reflected from the core. In a first step, for each core radius, a radial model of the lunar interior, including P and S wave velocities and density, is inverted from seismic and geodesic data. In a second step, the core radius is determined from the detection of shear waves reflected on the lunar core by waveform stacking of deep moonquake Apollo records. This detection has been made possible by careful data selection and processing, including a correction of the gain of horizontal sensors based on the principle of energy equipartition inside the coda of lunar seismic records, and a precise alignment of SH waveforms by a non-linear inversion method. The Very Preliminary REference MOON model (VPREMOON) obtained here has a core radius of 380±40km and an average core mass density of 5200±1000kg/m3. The large error bars on these estimates are due to the poorly constrained S-wave velocity profile at the base of the mantle and to mislocation errors of deep moonquakes. The detection of horizontally polarized S waves reflected from the core and the absence of detection of vertically polarized S waves favour a liquid state in the outermost part of the core. All these results are consistent, within their error bars, with previous estimates based on lunar rotation dissipation (Williams et al., 2001) and on lunar induced magnetic moment (Hood et al., 1999).},

Recent work that has modeled accretional growth in impact-generated disks has found that systems with one or two large moons and external debris are common outcomes. In this paper we investigate the evolution of terrestrial multiple-moon systems as they evolve due to mutual interactions (including mean motion resonances) and tidal interaction with Earth, using both analytical techniques and numerical integrations. We find that multiple-moon configurations that form from impact-generated disks are typically unstable: these systems will likely evolve into a single-moon state as the moons mutually collide or as the inner moonlet crashes into Earth.},

abstract = {The densities of 27 liquids in the system Na2O-K2O-MgO-MgO-FeO-Fe2O3-Al2O3-TiO2-SiO2 have been measured using the double-bob Archimedean technique. These results indicate that multicomponent silicate liquid volumes have a linear dependence on composition with the exception of the TiO2 component. The equation: V(T) = ∑Xi(T)Vi(T) + XNa2OXTiO2VNa2O-TiO2 was used to derive values of the oxide partial molar volumes (V̄i) by the method of least squares. Regressions were made separately at 1573, 1673, 1773 and 1873 K (as liquid ferric-ferrous ratios change with temperature) with relative standard errors for each fit of 0.38{\%}, 0.32{\%}, 0.30{\%} and 0.32{\%}, respectively. Derived dV̄i/dT values by separate least squares regression for each oxide component reproduce the measured dV/dT of the experimental liquids by 20.21{\%} on average. The effects of iron redox state on the density of a variety of natural liquids are demonstrated and at most amount to a variation of 1{\%}. These new data on silicate liquid volumes were used to re-derive oxide partial molar compressibilities, dV̄i,T/dP and $\backslash$́gbiT, at 1 bar from ultrasonic velocity and calorimetric data from the literature. The fits for dV̄i,T/dP and $\backslash$́gbi,T at 1673 K have relative standard errors of 3.9{\%} and 1.8{\%}, respectively, which represent substantial improvements over previous fits. Two applications of these volume data are given: firstly, the fusion curve of diopside is calculated up to 95 kbr using an equation of state for liquid volume expressed as: V(T, P) = V(T) exp ∝ -$\beta$(T)(1 − bP+cP2)dP (where $\beta$ = K−1 and therefore dK/dP = K′ = −$\beta$−2d$\beta$/dP); secondly, using a range of K′ appropriate to a komatiite liquid, the pressure-temperature conditions where the density of the liquid equals that of its olivine phenocrysts are calculated.},

abstract = {Calculations of isobaric batch, polybaric batch, and polybaric fractional melting have been carried out on a variety of proposed lunar and terrestrial source region compositions. Results show that magmas with a generally tholeiitic character—plagioclase and high-Ca pyroxene crystallize before low-Ca pyroxene reflecting relatively high Al2O3 concentrations ({\textgreater}12wt{\%})—are the inevitable consequence of anhydrous partial melting of source regions composed primarily of olivine and two pyroxenes with an aluminous phase on the solidus. Low-Al2O3 magmas ({\textless}10wt{\%}), as typified by the green picritic glasses in the lunar maria require deep (700–1000km), low-Al2O3 source regions without an aluminous phase. The difference between primitive and depleted mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges amounts to less than 0.1wt{\%} Al2O3, whereas formation of the green glass source region requires a net loss of between 1.5 and 2.5wt{\%} Al2O3. Basalt extraction cannot account for fractionations of this magnitude. Accumulation of olivine and pyroxene at the base of a crystallizing magma ocean is, however, an effective method for producing the necessary Al2O3 depletions. Both olivine-rich and pyroxene-rich source regions can produce the picritic magmas, but mixing calculations show that both types of source region are likely to be hybrids consisting of an early- to intermediate-stage cumulate (olivine plus enstatite) and a later stage cumulate assemblage. Mass balance calculations show that refractory element-enriched bulk Moon compositions contain too much Al2O3 to allow for the deep low-Al2O3 source regions even after extraction of an Al2O3-rich (26–30wt{\%}) crust between 50 and 70km thick.},

@article{Ringwood1987,
abstract = {The lunar crust at the Apollo 16 landing site contains substantial amounts of a “primitive component” in which the ferromagnesian group of elements is concentrated. The composition of this component can be retrieved via an analysis of mixing relationships displayed by lunar breccias. It is found to be a komatiite which is compositionally similar to terrestrial komatiites both in major and minor elements. The komatiite component of the lunar crust is believed to have formed by extensive degrees of melting of the lunar interior at depths greater than were involved in the formation of the lunar magma ocean which was parental to the crust. After formation of the anorthositic crust, it was invaded by extensive flows and intrusions of komatiite magma from these deeper source regions. The komatiites became intimately mixed with the anorthosite by intensive meteoroid impacts about 4.5 b.y. ago, thereby accounting for the observed mixing relationships displayed by the crust. The compositional similarity between lunar and terrestrial komatiites strongly implies a corresponding similarity between the compositions of their source regions in the lunar interior and the Earth's upper mantle. The composition of the lunar interior can be modelled more specifically by combining the komatiite composition with its liquidus olivine composition (as determined experimentally) in proportions chosen so as to produce a cosmochemically acceptable range of Mg/Si ratios for the bulk Moon. Except for higher FeO and lower Na2O, the range of compositions thereby obtained for the bulk moon is very similar to the composition of the Earth's upper mantle. The effects of meteoritic contamination on the abundances of cobalt and nickel in lunar highland breccias were subtracted on the assumption that the contaminating projectiles were chondritic. The cobalt and nickel residuals thereby obtained were found to correlate strongly with the (Mg + Fe) content of the breccias, demonstrating that the Co and Ni are associated with the ferromagnesian component of the breccias and are genuinely indigenous to the Moon. The lunar highland Co and Ni residuals also display striking Ni/Co versus Ni correlations which follow a similar trend to those displayed by terrestrial basalts, picrites and komatiites. The lunar trends provide further decisive evidence of the indigenous nature of the Co and Ni residuals and suggest the operation of extensive fractionation controlled by olivine-liquid equilibria in producing the primitive component of the lunar breccias. Indigenous nickel abundances at the Apollo 14, 15 and 17 sites are much lower than at the Apollo 16 site, although rocks from all sites follow the same Ni/Co versus Ni trends. It is suggested that the primitive component at the Apollo 14, 15 and 17 sites was generally of basaltic composition, in contrast to the komatiitic nature of the Apollo 16 primitive component.},

abstract = {The final stage of planet formation is dominated by collisions between planetary embryos. The dynamics of this stage determine the orbital configuration and the mass and composition of planets in the system. In the solar system, late giant impacts have been proposed for Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Pluto. In the case of Mercury, this giant impact may have significantly altered the bulk composition of the planet. Here we present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of high-velocity (up to {\~{}}5 v esc ) collisions between 1 and 10 M ? planets of initially terrestrial composition to investigate the end stages of formation of extrasolar super-Earths. As found in previous simulations of collisions between smaller bodies, when collision energies exceed simple merging, giant impacts are divided into two regimes: (1) disruption and (2) hit-and-run (a grazing inelastic collision and projectile escape). Disruption occurs when the impact parameter is near zero, when the projectile mass is small compared to the target, or at extremely high velocities. In the disruption regime, we derive the criteria for catastrophic disruption (when half the total colliding mass is lost), the transition energy between accretion and erosion, and a scaling law for the change in bulk composition (iron-to-silicate ratio) resulting from collisional stripping of a mantle.},

abstract = {The viscosity of synthetic peridotite liquid has been investigated at high pressures using in-situ falling sphere viscometry by combining a multi-anvil technique with synchrotron radiation. We used a newly designed capsule containing a small recessed reservoir outside of the hot spot of the heater, in which a viscosity marker sphere is embedded in a forsterite+enstatite mixture having a higher solidus temperature than the peridotite. This experimental setup prevents spheres from falling before a stable temperature above the liquidus is established and thus avoids difficulties in evaluating viscosities from velocities of spheres falling through a partially molten sample. Experiments have been performed between 2.8 and 13 GPa at temperatures ranging from 2043 to 2523 K. Measured viscosities range from 0.019 (±0.004) to 0.13 (±0.02) Pa s. At constant temperature, viscosity increases with increasing pressure up to ∼8.5 GPa but then decreases between ∼8.5 and 13 GPa. The change in the pressure dependence of viscosity is likely associated with structural changes of the liquid that occur upon compression. By combining our results with recently published 0.1 MPa peridotite liquid viscosities [D.B. Dingwell, C. Courtial, D. Giordano, A. Nichols, Viscosity of peridotite liquid, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 226 (2004) 127–138.], the experimental data can be described by a non-Arrhenian, empirical Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation, which has been modified by adding a term to account for the observed pressure dependence of viscosity. This equation reproduces measured viscosities to within 0.08 log10-units on average. We use this model to calculate viscosities of a peridotitic magma ocean along a liquid adiabat to a depth of ∼400 km and discuss possible effects on viscosity at greater pressures and temperatures than experimentally investigated.},

Growth rates and mode selection of the instability are systematically studied as a function of the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid and as a function of the inclination of the rotation axis compared to the deformation plane. We also quantify the saturation amplitude of the flow driven by the instability and calculate the viscous dissipation that it causes.

abstract = {Several studies have already considered the influence of tides on the evolution of systems composed of a star and a close-in companion to tentatively explain different observations such as the spin-up of some stars with hot Jupiters, the radius anomaly of short orbital period planets and the synchronization or quasi-synchronization of the stellar spin in some extreme cases. However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal dissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the so-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems, explaining some systematic features present in the observations. This hydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical streamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such systems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the influence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot Jupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated to the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of ad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of compressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the incompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability to grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized latitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the fluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a centrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an incompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability. Finally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the main tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and misaligned stars is consistent with current data.},

When the temperature profile is destabilizing, we observe (i) that the elliptical instability can still grow on the established convective motions, (ii) that for the experimental range of parameters, its growth rate progressively decreases when the intensity of convection increases, and (iii) that the elliptical instability modifies the heat transfer when the viscousboundary layer is smaller than the thermal one.

In order to simulate the chemical behavior of a two-phase (melt+vapor) disk, we calculate the temperature-dependent pressure and chemical composition of vapor in equilibrium with molten silicate from 2000 to 4000?K. We consider the elements O, Na,?K, Fe, Si, Mg, Ca, Al, Ti, and Zn for a range of bulk silicate compositions (Earth, Moon, Mars, eucrite parent body, angrites, and ureilites). In general, the disk atmosphere is dominated by Na, Zn, and O 2 at lower temperatures ({\textless}3000?K) and SiO, O 2 , and O at higher temperatures. The high-temperature chemistry is consistent for any silicate melt composition, and we thus expect abundant SiO, O 2 , and O to be a common feature of hot, impact-generated debris disks. In addition, the saturated silicate vapor is highly oxidizing, with oxygen fugacity ( {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/767/1/L12/apjl466344ieqn1.gif] {\{}{\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm O{\_}2{\}}{\$}{\}} ) values (and hence H 2 O/H 2 and CO 2 /CO ratios) several orders of magnitude higher than those in a solar-composition gas.

abstract = {Recent (142)Nd isotope data indicate that the silicate Earth (its crust plus the mantle) has a samarium to neodymium elemental ratio (Sm/Nd) that is greater than that of the supposed chondritic building blocks of the planet. This elevated Sm/Nd has been ascribed either to a 'hidden' reservoir in the Earth or to loss of an early-formed terrestrial crust by impact ablation. Since removal of crust by ablation would also remove the heat-producing elements--potassium, uranium and thorium--such removal would make it extremely difficult to balance terrestrial heat production with the observed heat flow. In the 'hidden' reservoir alternative, a complementary low-Sm/Nd layer is usually considered to reside unobserved in the silicate lower mantle. We have previously shown, however, that the core is a likely reservoir for some lithophile elements such as niobium. We therefore address the question of whether core formation could have fractionated Nd from Sm and also acted as a sink for heat-producing elements. We show here that addition of a reduced Mercury-like body (or, alternatively, an enstatite-chondrite-like body) rich in sulfur to the early Earth would generate a superchondritic Sm/Nd in the mantle and an (142)Nd/(144)Nd anomaly of approximately +14 parts per million relative to chondrite. In addition, the sulfur-rich core would partition uranium strongly and thorium slightly, supplying a substantial part of the 'missing' heat source for the geodynamo.},

abstract = {The thermal regime of the core is controlled by the heat flux taken by the mantle across the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and its ratio Nu, the Nusselt number, to the conductive heat flux along the core adiabat. If Nu {\textgreater} 1, then compositional convection from the inner-core boundary (ICB) will be augmented by thermal convection from the CMB, and the outer core will be well-mixed and unstratified. If Nu {\textless} 1, as some recent estimates suggest, there is a competition between a stabilising thermal buoyancy flux from the CMB and the convective compositional buoyancy flux from the ICB. An entirely analogous competition arises if light elements diffuse from the mantle into the core. A fundamental question is whether such a stabilising buoyancy flux can stratify a layer at the CMB and, if so, how thick the layer would be. A simple spherically averaged fluid-mechanical and thermodynamic model is derived and used to examine the possibilities. Previous suggestions that compositional convection is sufficiently vigorous to maintain a well-mixed state require active entrainment downwards of buoyant fluid, which is doubtful if inertial effects are negligible. It is suggested instead that a stratified layer accumulates below the CMB, which is not incorporated into the underlying convection zone, though it may be mixed slowly by double-diffusive ‘salt-fingering.' The thickness of the layer is calculated theoretically as a function of the controlling fluxes of heat and composition across the CMB. In the thermal case, the layer thickness adjusts rapidly to reflect the current value of Nu and is largely independent of the cooling history. The layer thickness is of order 100 km for Nu = 0.9, with a buoyancy frequency less than 10−4 s−1. The compositional case typically gives a thinner but more strongly stratified layer and adjusts more slowly. Seismic, geomagnetic and length-of-day evidence for such layers is assessed.},

Many satellite-sized bodies are found to be available for capture, cratering, or collisional fragmentation. In the case of Earth-sized planets, the models suggest second-largest bodies of 500 to 3000 km radius, and tens of bodies larger than 100 km radius. Many of these interact with the planet before suffering any fragmentation events with each other. Collision of a large body with Earth could eject iron-deficient crust and upper mantle material, forming a cloud of refractory, volatile-poor dust that could form the Moon. Other satellite systems may have been affected by major capture or collision events of chance character.},

abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5{\%} and 15{\%} of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at ∼ 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (∼ 10 ± 5{\%}) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk FeAl of ∼ 20 ± 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (∼ 14{\%}) and the core (∼ 86{\%}). Chondritic meteorites display a range of FeAl ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's.},

abstract = {To characterize the heavy noble gas composition of MORBs we present new He, Ne, Ar, and Xe abundances and isotopic compositions from the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Both depleted MORBs nominally devoid of plume influence and more enriched MORBs thought to represent the influence of a HIMU mantle plume are present in close geographical proximity in this region. Ne–Ar–Xe isotopic compositions in individual step-crushes are correlated, which, along with significant radiogenic excesses, allows correction for shallow-level air contamination. Based on the relationship between the noble gases and the lithophile isotopes (Sr, Nd and Pb), the depleted MORB mantle has a 21Ne/22Ne between 0.0617 and 0.0646, 40Ar/36Ar ratio of 41,500±9000 and 129Xe/130Xe ratio of 7.77±0.06. On the other hand, the HIMU-type MORBs are characterized by far less radiogenic Ne, Ar and Xe isotopic compositions with mantle source 21Ne/22Ne between 0.0544 and 0.0610, and 40Ar/36Ar and 129Xe/130Xe ratios of 18,100±600 and 7.21±0.06, respectively. The observation of less nucleogenic 21Ne/22Ne in HIMU-type MORBs is similar to observations from HIMU ocean islands and requires the HIMU plume to be comprised of both recycled and primitive material. Within the depleted MORBs we observe He and Ne to be negatively correlated. The observation suggests that along the equatorial Atlantic the most depleted MORBs are related to normal MORBs through the addition of a small proportion of a HIMU plume component. Our new Xe isotopic measurements demonstrate distinct 129Xe/136Xe ratios in the mantle sources of depleted MORBs, HIMU-type MORBs and the Iceland plume. While substantial injection of atmospheric Xe into these mantle sources is implied, the differences in Xe isotopic composition cannot result solely from recycling of air. Rather, they require that mantle plumes sample a reservoir less degassed than the depleted MORB mantle. This conclusion is consistent with a higher proportion of Pu- to U-derived fission Xe in Iceland and HIMU-type MORBs compared to the depleted MORBs. Overall, the Xe isotopic compositions imply that mantle plumes tap a reservoir that separated from the MORB source within the first 100 million years of Earth's history and that the two reservoirs have had limited direct mixing since then.},

abstract = {Variations in heavy noble gas (Ne, Ar, Xe) isotopic compositions provide unique insights into the nature of heterogeneities in the mantle. However, few precise constraints on mantle source heavy noble gas isotopic compositions are available due to ubiquitous shallow-level atmospheric contamination. As a result, the extent of heterogeneity in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle source Ne, Ar and Xe isotopic compositions is unknown. Basalts from the ultra-slow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) between 7°E and 25°E exhibit remarkable variability in He isotopic composition: SWIR 4He/3He spans half the total range observed in all mantle-derived basalts. Therefore, basalts from the SWIR provide a unique window into upper mantle heterogeneity and present an ideal opportunity to characterize variations in upper mantle heavy noble gas isotopic composition. Here we present new high-precision Ne, Ar and Xe isotopic compositions as well as He, CO2, Ne, Ar and Xe abundances measured in basalt glasses from the SWIR. After correcting the measured values for shallow-level atmospheric contamination, significant and systematic variations in mantle source Ne, Ar and Xe compositions are observed. We note that large variations in source 40Ar/36Ar and 129Xe/130Xe are observed in basalts removed from the influence of known hotspots, indicating a heterogeneous mid-ocean ridge basalt source. Thus, SWIR heavy noble gas data reveal a greater degree of source heterogeneity than is evident in the 4He/3He systematics alone. The observed heavy noble gas isotopic heterogeneities imply that the average MORB source 40Ar/36Ar and 129Xe/130Xe ratios are not yet well-determined. Variation in MORB source 40Ar/36Ar and 129Xe/130Xe at a given 4He/3He and 21Ne/22Ne may reflect heterogeneous recycling of atmospheric Ar and Xe. In particular, we find low mantle source 40Ar/36Ar and 129Xe/130Xe ratios in the eastern region of the study area, which may reflect the noble gas signature of the Dupal mantle domain. Our observations require that the sampled mantle domain either is very ancient ({\textgreater}4.45Ga) or has been metasomatized by subduction zone fluids carrying recycled atmospheric Ar and Xe. However, our Xe isotopic measurements indicate that differences between MORB and ocean island basalt (OIB) source noble gas compositions cannot be explained by recycling of atmospheric noble gases alone. Instead, a relatively undegassed mantle reservoir is required to account for OIB noble gases. The SWIR data demonstrate that the reservoir supplying primordial noble gases to mantle plumes differentiated from the MORB source early in Earth history, and the two reservoirs have not been homogenized over 4.45Ga of mantle convection.},

Certain basins and orographic depressions show even higher enrichment, while high altitude regions show much lower values (1 to 3 VSMOW).

abstract = {Nitrogen and noble gas (Ne–Ar) abundances and isotope ratios, determined by CO2 laser extraction static mass spectrometry analysis, as well as Al–Mg and O isotope data from secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses, are reported for a type B calcium–aluminum-rich inclusion (CAI) from the CV3 chondrite NWA 8616. The high (26Al/27Al)i ratio of (5.06±0.50)×10−5 dates the last melting event of the CAI at 39-99+109ka after “time zero”, limiting the period during which high-temperature exchanges between the CAI and the nebular gas could have occurred to a very short time interval. Partial isotopic exchange with a 16O-poor reservoir resulted in $\Delta$17O{\textgreater}−5‰ for melilite and anorthite, whereas spinel and Al–Ti-pyroxene retain the inferred original 16O-rich signature of the solar nebula ($\Delta$17O⩽−20‰). The low 20Ne/22Ne (⩽0.83) and 36Ar/38Ar (⩽0.75) ratios of the CAI rule out the presence of any trapped planetary or solar noble gases. Cosmogenic 21Ne and 38Ar abundances are consistent with a cosmic ray exposure (CRE) age of ∼14 to 20Ma, assuming CR fluxes similar to modern ones, without any evidence for pre-irradiation of the CAI before incorporation into the meteorite parent body. Strikingly, the CAI contains 1.4–3.4ppmN with a $\delta$15N value of +8‰ to +30‰. Even after correcting the measured $\delta$15N values for cosmogenic 15N produced in situ, the CAI is highly enriched in 15N compared to the protosolar nebula ($\delta$15NPSN=−383±8‰; Marty et al., 2011), implying that the CAI-forming region was contaminated by 15N-rich material within the first 0.15Ma of Solar System history, or, alternatively, that the CAI was ejected into the outer Solar System where it interacted with a 15N-rich reservoir.},

abstract = {Magnetic fields are proposed to have played a critical role in some of the most enigmatic processes of planetary formation by mediating the rapid accretion of disk material onto the central star and the formation of the first solids. However, there have been no experimental constraints on the intensity of these fields. Here we show that dusty olivine-bearing chondrules from the Semarkona meteorite were magnetized in a nebular field of 54 ± 21 microteslas. This intensity supports chondrule formation by nebular shocks or planetesimal collisions rather than by electric currents, the x-wind, or other mechanisms near the Sun. This implies that background magnetic fields in the terrestrial planet-forming region were likely 5 to 54 microteslas, which is sufficient to account for measured rates of mass and angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks.},

abstract = {Large outpourings of basaltic lava have punctuated geological time, but the mechanisms responsible for the generation of such extraordinary volumes of melt are not well known. Recent geochemical evidence suggests that an early-formed reservoir may have survived in the Earth's mantle for about 4.5 billion years (ref. 2), and melts of this reservoir contributed to the flood basalt emplaced on Baffin Island about 60 million years ago. However, the volume of this ancient mantle domain and whether it has contributed to other flood basalts is not known. Here we show that basalts from the largest volcanic event in geologic history--the Ontong Java plateau--also exhibit the isotopic and trace element signatures proposed for the early-Earth reservoir. Together with the Ontong Java plateau, we suggest that six of the largest volcanic events that erupted in the past 250 million years derive from the oldest terrestrial mantle reservoir. The association of these large volcanic events with an ancient primitive mantle source suggests that its unique geochemical characteristics--it is both hotter (it has greater abundances of the radioactive heat-producing elements) and more fertile than depleted mantle reservoirs-may strongly affect the generation of flood basalts.},

abstract = {Seismic tomography and numerical simulations show that the western Pacific slab bends horizontally when it reaches the boundary between the upper mantle and lower mantle beneath northeast Asia. It is expected that a metastable olivine wedge (MOW) exists in the cold core of the slab because of a delayed phase transition from olivine to its high-pressure polymorphs. However, it is still debated whether the MOW actually exists or not, and even if it exists, its physical properties, such as seismic velocity and density, are still unclear. In this work we use high-quality arrival-time data of 17 deep earthquakes occurring within the Pacific slab under northeast Asia to study the detailed structure of the slab. The deep earthquakes are relocated precisely by applying a modified double-difference location method to arrival-time data recorded at both Chinese and Japanese stations. Based on the precise hypocentral locations, a forward modeling method and differential travel-time residuals data are used to estimate seismic velocity within the deep source zone, which can decrease or remove the influence of ambient velocity heterogeneities. Our results show that the MOW does exist within the Pacific slab under northeast Asia, and the MOW has a mean velocity anomaly of 7–9{\%} lower than the iasp91 Earth model. The existence of MOW in the slab has important geodynamic implications. It can reduce the speed of slab subduction and affect the generation of deep earthquakes.},

These perturbations correspond in planetary terms to tides, precession, and longitudinal libration. We review here the flows driven by those mechanical forcings on rotating spheres and ellipsoids. Special focus is placed on the associated instabilities and on the various routes toward turbulence recently studied. The key point is that mechanical forcings do not provide the energy to the excited flows: They convey part of the available rotational energy and generate intense fluid motions through the excitation of localized jets, shear layers, and resonant inertial modes. Hence, even very small forcings may have large-scale consequences. Mechanically driven flows thus play a fundamental role in planets and stars, significantly influencing their shape, their rotational dynamics, and their mag...},

abstract = {▪ Abstract In this review we describe the discovery and development of understanding of the so-called elliptical instability. This is the name given to the linear instability mechanism that tends to break up regions of elliptical streamlines in a rotating flow. The instability is discussed in the three different contexts—an unbounded strained vortex, a localized strained vortex, and a triaxial ellipsoid—where it was originally discovered and then rediscovered. These make it clear that the instability is one of parametric resonance where a normal mode, or pair of normal modes, of the undistorted rotating flow resonates with the underlying strain field. The effects of additional physics on the instability process are examined before its nonlinear evolution is discussed. Various applications of the instability in nature are then reviewed.},

abstract = {Impacts that leave the Earth-Moon system with a large excess in angular momentum have recently been advocated as a means of generating a protolunar disc with a composition that is nearly identical to that of the Earth's mantle. We here investigate the accretion of the Moon from discs generated by such 'non-canonical' impacts, which are typically more compact than discs produced by canonical impacts and have a higher fraction of their mass initially located inside the Roche limit. Our model predicts a similar overall accretional history for both canonical and non-canonical discs, with the Moon forming in three consecutive steps over hundreds of years. However, we find that, to yield a lunar-mass Moon, the more compact non-canonical discs must initially be more massive than implied by prior estimates, and only a few of the discs produced by impact simulations to date appear to meet this condition. Non-canonical impacts require that capture of the Moon into the evection resonance with the Sun reduced the Earth-Moon angular momentum by a factor of 2 or more. We find that the Moon's semi-major axis at the end of its accretion is approximately 7R⊕, which is comparable to the location of the evection resonance for a post-impact Earth with a 2.5 h rotation period in the absence of a disc. Thus, the dynamics of the Moon's assembly may directly affect its ability to be captured into the resonance.},

abstract = {Thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) was used to measure the calcium isotopic compositions of carbonaceous, ordinary, enstatite chondrites as well as eucrites and aubrites. We find that after correction for mass-fractionation by internal normalization to a fixed 42Ca/44Ca ratio, the 43Ca/44Ca and 46Ca/44Ca ratios are indistinguishable from terrestrial ratios. In contrast, the 48Ca/44Ca ratios show significant departure from the terrestrial composition (from −2 $\epsilon$ in eucrites to +4 $\epsilon$ in CO and CV chondrites). Isotopic anomalies in $\epsilon$48Ca correlate with $\epsilon$50Ti: $\epsilon$Ca48=(1.09±0.11)×$\epsilon$Ti50+(0.03±0.14). Further work is needed to identify the carrier phase of 48Ca–50Ti anomalies but we suggest that it could be perovskite and that the stellar site where these anomalies were created was also responsible for the nucleosynthesis of the bulk of the solar system inventory of these nuclides. The Earth has identical 48Ca isotopic composition to enstatite chondrites (EH and EL) and aubrites. This adds to a long list of elements that display nucleosynthetic anomalies at a bulk planetary scale but show identical or very similar isotopic compositions between enstatite chondrites, aubrites, and Earth. This suggests that the inner protoplanetary disk was characterized by a uniform isotopic composition (IDUR for Inner Disk Uniform Reservoir), sampled by enstatite chondrites and aubrites, from which the Earth drew most of its constituents. The terrestrial isotopic composition for 17O, 48Ca, 50Ti, 62Ni, and 92Mo is well reproduced by a mixture of 91{\%} enstatite, 7{\%} ordinary, and 2{\%} carbonaceous chondrites. The Earth was not simply made of enstatite chondrites but it formed from the same original material that was later modified by nebular and disk processes. The Moon-forming impactor probably came from the same region as the other embryos that made the Earth, explaining the strong isotopic similarity between lunar and terrestrial rocks.},

We find that the likely semimajor axis of Theia, at the epoch when our simulations begin, depends on the assumed mass ratio of Earth–Moon progenitors (8/1, 4/1, or 1/1). The low eccentricities of the terrestrial planets are most commonly produced when the progenitors have similar semimajor axes at the epoch when our integrations commence.

abstract = {We present results of a study of the 53Mn-53Cr systematics in various solar system objects: angrites, eucrites, chondrites, diogenites, pallasites, the Earth and the Moon, and SNC meteorites. The primary goal of this study was to explore the capabilities of the 53Mn-53Cr isotope system as a chronometer and as a tracer for events in the early solar system, to obtain chronological information on different classes of meteorites, and to investigate the indigenous distribution of 53Mn in the late nebula. These studies have shown that all meteorite groups investigated so far have excess 53Cr relative to the terrestrial value. A lunar sample exhibits 53Cr/52Cr ratios which are the same as the terrestrial normal. The angrites, several eucrites, and the pallasites show clear evidence for the existence of life 53Mn during their formation while other meteorites were isotopically equilibrated after essentially all 53Mn had decayed. A well defined whole-rock 53Mn-53Cr isochron for the HED (Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite) parent body was obtained. The isochron indicates that this planetesimal was essentially totally molten and differentiated ∼7 Ma before the angrites crystallized. Using the absolute age of the angrites as a time marker this event has occurred 4565 Ma ago, within present uncertainties at the same time when high temperature meteorite inclusions (CAI) were formed in the nebula. The first basalts were deposited onto its surface within less than 3 Ma. The bulk Mn/Cr ratios of the HED parent body (presumably Vesta), the angrites, and the pallasites are consistent with a chondritic Mn/Cr ratio. The results from the SCN meteorites show that their 53Cr excesses are less than half of those found in the other meteorites. Thus, the characteristic 53Cr/52Cr ratio of Mars (assuming SNCs originate from this planet) are intermediate between that of the earth-moon system and those of the other meteorites. When these 53Cr excesses are plotted as a function of the heliocentric distance of the place of origin of the samples then a linear relationship is indicated. Provided that this variation is due to the decay of 53Mn then a radial heterogeneous distribution of 53Mn must have existed in at least the inner early solar system. It is argued that radial fractionation within the nebula, based on the slightly higher volatility of Mn as compared to that of Cr, is an unlikely cause for this distribution. Thus, it must be an intrinsic feature of the late solar nebula. Stochastic mixing processes at the planetary embryo stage did obviously not eradicate this heterogeneity. Based on the 53Mn-53Cr systematics in HED meteorites and in chondrites rather narrow limits are inferred for the age of the solar system or, more accurately, for the start of the decay of 53Mn within the solar nebula; the range of possible values is 4568–4571 Ma. The lower limit is consistent with the Pb-Pb ages of CAI's.},

The removal of apparent excesses is evident when wind yields from Wolf–Rayet stars are included in the plot of radionuclide abundances vs. mean life. The resulting trend indicates that the solar radionuclides were inherited from parental molecular clouds with a characteristic residence time of 108 yr. This residence time is of the same order as the present-day timescale for conversion of molecular cloud material into stars. The concentrations of these extinct isotopes in the early solar system need not signify injection from unusual proximal stellar sources, but instead are well explained by normal concentrations in average star-forming clouds. The results imply that the efficiency of capture is greater for stellar winds than for supernova ejecta proximal to star-forming regions.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present an extensive suite of terrestrial planet formation simulations that allows quantitative analysis of the stochastic late stages of planet formation. We quantify the feeding zone width, Delta a, as the mass-weighted standard deviation of the initial semi-major axes of the planetary embryos and planetesimals that make up the final planet. The size of a planet's feeding zone in our simulations does not correlate with its final mass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a planet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the feeding zone of any planet more massive than 0.1M{\_}Earth is roughly proportional to the radial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta a{\~{}}0.25(a{\_}max-a{\_}min), where a{\_}min and a{\_}max are the inner and outer edge of the initial planetesimal disk. These wide stochastic feeding zones have significant consequences for the origin of the Moon, since the canonical scenario predicts the Moon should be primarily composed of material from Earth's last major impactor (Theia), yet its isotopic composition is indistinguishable from Earth. In particular, we find that the feeding zones of Theia analogs are significantly more stochastic than the planetary analogs. Depending on our assumed initial distribution of oxygen isotopes within the planetesimal disk, we find a {\~{}}5{\%} or less probability that the Earth and Theia will form with an isotopic difference equal to or smaller than the Earth and Moon's. In fact we predict that every planetary mass body should be expected to have a unique isotopic signature. In addition, we find paucities of massive Theia analogs and high velocity moon-forming collisions, two recently proposed explanations for the Moon's isotopic composition. Our work suggests that there is still no scenario for the Moon's origin that explains its isotopic composition with a high probability event.},

abstract = {The source rocks for basaltic lavas that form ocean islands are often inferred to have risen as part of a thermal plume from the lower mantle. These rocks are water-rich compared with average upper-mantle rocks. However, experiments indicate that the solubility of water in the dominant lower-mantle phases is very low, prompting suggestions that plumes may be sourced from as-yet unidentified reservoirs of water-rich primordial material in the deep mantle. Here we perform high-pressure experiments to show that Al2SiO4(OH)2[mdash]the aluminium-rich endmember of dense, hydrous magnesium silicate phase D[mdash]is stable at temperatures extending to over 2,000 [deg]C at 26 GPa. We find that under these conditions, Al-rich phase D is stable within mafic rocks, which implies that subducted oceanic crust could be a significant long-term water reservoir in the convecting lower mantle. We suggest that melts formed in the lower mantle by the dehydration of hydrous minerals in dense ultramafic rocks will migrate into mafic lithologies and crystallize to form Al-rich phase D. When mantle rocks upwell, water will be locally redistributed into nominally anhydrous minerals. This upwelling material provides a potential source for ocean-island basalts without requiring reservoirs of water-rich primordial material in the deep mantle.},

abstract = {There is a long-standing hypothesis that the last fraction of the lunar magma ocean crystallized into a layer of dense, Ti-rich cumulate minerals at shallow depths (∼100 km) early in the moon's history. Many questions remain about the stability of these high-Ti cumulates. It has been suggested that the cumulates subsequently sank deep into the moon because of gravitational instability, but high-Ti material is required at shallower depths by 3.5 Ga to create the high-Ti mare basalts and picritic glasses. The high-Ti material may have re-erupted from depth, or some or all of it may have remained at shallow depths throughout lunar history. Data on phase stabilities, bulk compositions, densities, and temperatures of melting and crystallizing in addition to results from numerical modeling suggest that the high-Ti cumulates would sink only under highly specific conditions. Five scenarios for sinking high-Ti cumulate materials are examined, and only two are found plausible. In particular, it is found that simple sinking of solidified high-Ti cumulates is unlikely because the temperature at which the cumulates solidify is low, and viscosity under these conditions is very high. It is, however, possible that high-Ti cumulates mixed with a substantial fraction of olivine would have viscosity low enough to allow them to sink as solids. Further, because clinopyroxene and ilmenite melt in a ratio of 2:1, remelted high-Ti cumulates would be negatively buoyant and sink as liquids, percolating downward through the underlying mantle and beginning to recrystallize ilmenite at 200 km depth, making a hybrid, heterogeneous mantle.},

abstract = {Angular momentum transport due to hydrodynamic turbulent convection is studied using local three-dimensional numerical simulations employing the shearing box approximation. We determine the turbulent viscosity from non-rotating runs over a range of values of the shear parameter and use a simple analytical model in order to extract the non-diffusive contribution ($\Lambda$-effect) to the stress in runs where rotation is included. Our results suggest that the turbulent viscosity is on the order of the mixing length estimate and weakly affected by rotation. The $\Lambda$-effect is non-zero and a factor of 2-4 smaller than the turbulent viscosity in the slow rotation regime. We demonstrate that for Keplerian shear, the angular momentum transport can change sign and be outward when the rotation period is greater than the turnover time, i.e., when the Coriolis number is below unity. This result seems to be relatively independent of the value of the Rayleigh number.},

abstract = {The accretion of a terrestrial body and differentiation of its silicate/oxide mantle from iron core provide abundant energy for heating its interior to temperatures much higher than the present day Earth. The consequences of differentiation on the structure and composition of planets are typically addressed considering only the interaction of molten iron with an immiscible ‘rocky' phase. We demonstrate that mixing in a representative system of liquid or solid MgO and liquid iron to a single homogeneous liquid occurs at sufficiently low temperature to be present in the aftermath of a giant impact. Applying the thermodynamic integration technique to density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the solvus closure temperature for the Fe–MgO system for pressures up to 400 GPa. Solvus closure occurs at ∼4000 K at low pressure, and has a weak positive pressure dependence, such that its gradient with respect to depth is less steep than an adiabatic temperature profile. This predicts a new mode of core–mantle differentiation following the most energetic giant impacts, with exsolution of iron from the mixture beginning in the outer layers of the planet. We demonstrate that high-temperature equilibration results in delivery of nominally insoluble Mg-rich material to the early core. Since MgO is the least soluble major mantle component in iron at low temperatures, these results may represent an upper bound on temperature for mixing in terrestrial planets.},

abstract = {The giant gas planets have hot convective interiors, and therefore a common assumption is that these deep atmospheres are close to a barotropic state. Here we show using a new anelastic general circulation model that baroclinic vorticity contributions are not negligible, and drive the system away from an isentropic and therefore barotropic state. The motion is still aligned with the direction of the axis of rotation as in a barotropic rotating fluid, but the wind structure has a vertical shear with stronger winds in the atmosphere than in the interior. This shear is associated with baroclinic compressibility effects. Most previous convection models of giant planets have used the Boussinesq approximation, which assumes the density is constant in depth; however, Jupiter's actual density varies by four orders of magnitude through its deep molecular envelope. We therefore developed a new general circulation model (based on the MITgcm) that is anelastic and thereby incorporates this density variation. The model's geometry is a full 3D sphere down to a small inner core. It is nonhydrostatic, uses an equation of state suitable for hydrogen–helium mixtures (SCVH), and is driven by an internal heating profile. We demonstrate the effect of compressibility by comparing anelastic and Boussinesq cases. The simulations develop a mean state that is geostrophic and hydrostatic including the often neglected, but significant, vertical Coriolis contribution. This leads to modification of the standard thermal wind relation for a deep compressible atmosphere. The interior flow organizes in large cyclonically rotating columnar eddies parallel to the rotation axis, which drive upgradient angular momentum eddy fluxes, generating the observed equatorial superrotation. Heat fluxes align with the axis of rotation, and provide a mechanism for the transport of heat poleward, which can cause the observed flat meridional emission. We address the issue of over-forcing which is common in such convection models and analyze the dependence of our results on this; showing that the vertical wind structure is not very sensitive to the Rayleigh number. We also study the effect of rotation, showing how the transition from a rapidly to a slowly rotating system affects the dynamics.},

The Moon's chemical make-up, however, differs from the Earth's in its low volatile content and perhaps in the elevated abundance of oxidized iron. This surprising situation is not readily explained by current impact models of the Moon's origin and offers a major clue to the Moon's formation, if we only could understand it properly. Current ideas to explain this similarity range from assuming an impactor with the same isotopic composition as the Earth to postulating a pure ice impactor that completely vaporized upon impact. Several recent proposals follow from the suggestion that the Earth-Moon system may have lost a great deal of angular momentum during early resonant interactions. The isotopic constraint may be the most stringent test yet for theories of the Moon's origin.},

The spatial resolution for the impact-generated disk is greatly improved from previous particle-based simulations. This allows us to explore the fine structures of a circumterrestrial debris disk and its long-term evolution. We find that in order to form a debris disk from which a lunar-sized satellite can be accumulated, the impact must result in a disk of mostly liquid or solid debris, where pressure is not effective, well before the accumulation process starts. If the debris is dominated by vapor gas, strong spiral shocks are generated, and therefore the circumterrestrial disk cannot survive more than several days. This suggests that there could be an appropriate mass range for terrestrial planets to harbor a large moon as a result of giant impacts, since vaporization during an impact depends on the impact energy.},

abstract = {Quantifying the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres. We examine the contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal accretion. Giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. Using analytic self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermal atmospheres with adiabatic index $\gamma$=5/3) that the local atmospheric mass loss fraction for ground velocities vg≲0.25vesc is given by $\chi$loss=(1.71vg/vesc)4.9, where vesc is the escape velocity from the target. Yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function of the impactor velocity vImp and mass mImp and given by Xloss≃0.4x+1.4x2-0.8x3 (isothermal atmosphere) and Xloss≃0.4x+1.8x2-1.2x3 (adiabatic atmosphere), where x=(vImpm/vescM). Atmospheric mass loss due to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: (1) large enough impactors m≳2$\rho$0($\pi$hR)3/2 (25km for the current Earth), are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, which ish/2R of the whole atmosphere, where h,R and $\rho$0 are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. (2) Smaller impactors, but above m{\textgreater}4$\pi$$\rho$0h3 (1km for the current Earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower limit (2km for the current Earth). For impactor flux size distributions parametrized by a single power law, N({\textgreater}r)∝r-q+1, with differential power law index q, we find that for 1{\textless}q{\textless}3 the atmospheric mass loss proceeds in regime (1) whereas for q{\textgreater}3 the mass loss is dominated by regime (2). Impactors with m≲4$\pi$$\rho$0h3 are not able to eject any atmosphere. Despite being bombarded by the same planetesimal population, we find that the current differences in Earth's and Venus' atmospheric masses can be explained by modest differences in their initial atmospheric masses and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimal impacts. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the terrestrial planets.},

abstract = {The formation of a protolunar disc by a giant impact with the early Earth is discussed, focusing on two classes of impacts: (i) canonical impacts, in which a Mars-sized impactor produces a planet-disc system whose angular momentum is comparable to that in the current Earth and Moon, and (ii) high-angular-momentum impacts, which produce a system whose angular momentum is approximately a factor of 2 larger than that in the current Earth and Moon. In (i), the disc originates primarily from impactor-derived material and thus is expected to have an initial composition distinct from that of the Earth's mantle. In (ii), a hotter, more compact initial disc is produced with a silicate composition that can be nearly identical to that of the silicate Earth. Both scenarios require subsequent processes for consistency with the current Earth and Moon: disc-planet compositional equilibration in the case of (i), or large-scale angular momentum loss during capture of the newly formed Moon into the evection resonance with the Sun in the case of (ii).},

abstract = {One possible mechanism to explain the observed variability of the short-lived Sm146→Nd142 and Hf182→W182 systems recorded in some early Earth rocks is crystal–liquid fractionation and overturn in an early magma ocean. This process could also potentially explain the deviation between the 142Nd isotopic composition of the accessible Earth and the chondritic average. To examine these effects, the magma ocean solidification code of Elkins-Tanton (2008) and a modified Monte Carlo algorithm, designed to randomly choose physically reasonable trace element partition coefficients in crystallizing mantle phases, are used to model the isotopic evolution of early Earth reservoirs. This model, also constrained by the 143Nd composition of the accessible Earth, explores the effects of changing the amount of interstitial liquid trapped in cumulates, the half-life of 146Sm, the magnitude of late accretion, and the simplified model of post-overturn reservoir mixing. Regardless of the parameters used, our results indicate the generation of early mantle reservoirs with isotopic characteristics consistent with observed anomalies is a likely outcome of magma ocean crystallization and overturn of shallow, enriched, and dense (i.e., gravitationally unstable) cumulates. The high-iron composition and density of a hypothesized, early-formed enriched mantle reservoir is compatible with seismic observations indicating large, low-shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) (e.g., Trampert et al., 2004) present in the mantle today. Later melts of an enriched reservoir are likely to have remained isolated deep within the mantle (e.g., Thomas et al., 2012), consistent with the possibility that the presently observed LLSVPs could be partially or fully composed of remnants of an early enriched reservoir.},

In the simulations, both self-gravity and inelastic physical collisions are included. We first formalized expressions for angular momentum transfer rate including self-gravity and calculated the transfer rate with the results of our N-body simulations. Spiral structure is formed within the Roche limit by self-gravity and energy dissipation of inelastic collisions, and angular momentum is effectively transferred outward. Angular momentum transfer is dominated by both gravitational torque due to the spiral structure and particles' collective motion associated with the structure. Since formation and evolution of the spiral structure is regulated by the disk surface density, the angular momentum transfer rate depends on surface density, but not on particle size or number, so that the timescale of evolution of a particulate disk is independent of the number of particles (N) that is used to represent the disk, if N is large enough to represent the spiral structure. With N = 105, the detailed spiral structure is resolved, while it is only poorly resolved with N = 103; however, we found that calculated angular momentum transfer does not change as long as N  103.},

Contrary to an accretion timescale of a few months obtained with prior pure N-body codes, here the final stage of the Moon's growth is controlled by the slow spreading of the inner disk, resulting in a total lunar accretion timescale of {\~{}}102 years. It has been proposed that the inner disk may compositionally equilibrate with the Earth through diffusive mixing, which offers a potential explanation for the identical oxygen isotope compositions of the Earth and Moon. However, the mass fraction of the final Moon that is derived from the inner disk is limited by resonant torques between the disk and exterior growing moons.

abstract = {We have performed a two-phase fluid numerical simulation of the evolution of a partially vaporized circumplanetary disk. In the giant-impact hypothesis, gravitational instability is crucial for the moon-forming process. It causes outward transportation of disk material beyond the Roche radius, where the disk material can accrete into a moon. There are two possible modes of gravitational instability: one is the instability of the melt-vapor mixture following disk cooling, and the other is the instability of the equatorial melt layer formed by sedimentation in the disk. In this paper, we examine the latter possibility, which has been poorly understood. The major results obtained are as follows: (1) The sedimentation of melt droplets occurs in about 10-2 yr, which is much faster than the disk cooling ({\~{}}100 yr). (2) The gravitational instability of the melt layer occurs when the gas fraction is below the critical value ({\~{}}0.7). When the gas fraction exceeds the critical value, neither type of gravitational instability occurs. These results suggest that the constituent of the melt layer is transported beyond the Roche radius much faster than the disk cooling unless the gas fraction is extremely high. As a consequence, a volatile-poor moon is expected to be formed while the disk still remains hot.},

@article{Kokubo2000,
abstract = {We investigate the evolution of a circumterrestrial disk of debris generated by a giant impact on Earth and the dynamical characteristics of the moon accreted from the disk by using high-resolution N-body simulation. We find that in most cases the disk evolution results in the formation of a single large moon on a nearly circular orbit close to the equatorial plane of the initial disk just outside the Roche limit, which is consistent with the previous work by S. Ida et al. (1997, Nature389, 353–357). The efficiency of incorporation of disk material into a moon is 10–55{\%}, which increases with the initial specific angular momentum of the disk. These results hardly depend on the initial condition of the disk as long as the mass of the disk is 2 to 4 times the present lunar mass and most mass of the disk exists inside the Roche limit. The timescale of the disk evolution is determined mainly by the surface density of the disk because mass transfer to the outside of the Roche limit and formation of lunar seeds are regulated by collective behavior of disk particles. The evolution of the disk is summarized as follows: The disk contracts through collisional damping. As the velocity dispersion of disk particles decreases, particle clumps grow inside the Roche limit. The clumps become elongated due to Keplerian shear, which forms spiral arm-like structure. Particles are transfered to the outside of the Roche limit through the gravitational torque exerted by the spiral arms. When a tip of a spiral arm goes beyond the Roche limit, it collapses into a small moonlet. The rapid accretion of these small moonlets forms a lunar seed. The seed exclusively grows by sweeping up particles transfered over the Roche limit. When the moon becomes large enough to gravitationally dominate the disk, it pushes the rest of the inner disk to Earth. The formation timescale of the moon is of the order of 1 month if a particulate disk is assumed and the effect of melting/vaporization is not included.},

Lunar samples should be easily distinguishable from Earth, because the Moon derives mostly from the impacting planet, in standard models of the theory. But lunar rocks are the same as Earth in O, Ti, Cr, W, K, and other species, to measurement precision. Some regard this as a repudiation of the theory; others say it wants a reformation.

abstract = {Prior work has found that a variety of terrestrial planetary compositions are expected to occur within known extrasolar planetary systems. However, such studies ignored the effects of giant planet migration, which is thought to be very common in extrasolar systems. Here we present calculations of the compositions of terrestrial planets that formed in dynamical simulations incorporating varying degrees of giant planet migration. We used chemical equilibrium models of the solid material present in the disks of five known planetary host stars: the Sun, GJ 777, HD4203, HD19994, and HD213240. Giant planet migration has a strong effect on the compositions of simulated terrestrial planets as the migration results in large-scale mixing between terrestrial planet building blocks that condensed at a range of temperatures. This mixing acts to (1) increase the typical abundance of Mg-rich silicates in the terrestrial planets' feeding zones and thus increase the frequency of planets with Earth-like compositions compared with simulations with static giant planet orbits, and (2) drastically increase the efficiency of the delivery of hydrous phases (water and serpentine) to terrestrial planets and thus produce waterworlds and/or wet Earths. Our results demonstrate that although a wide variety of terrestrial planet compositions can still be produced, planets with Earth-like compositions should be common within extrasolar planetary systems.},

All three currently have climates determined by energy balance relationships involving carbon dioxide, water and aerosols, regulated by solar energy deposition, atmospheric and ocean circulation, composition, and cloud physics and chemistry. This paper addresses the extent to which current knowledge allows us to explain the observed state of each planet, its planetology, climatology and biology, within a common framework.

abstract = {The Moon is depleted in volatile elements relative to the Earth and Mars. Low abundances of volatile elements, fractionated stable isotope ratios of S, Cl, K and Zn, high $\mu$ ((238)U/(204)Pb) and long-term Rb/Sr depletion are distinguishing features of the Moon, relative to the Earth. These geochemical characteristics indicate both inheritance of volatile-depleted materials that formed the Moon and planets and subsequent evaporative loss of volatile elements that occurred during lunar formation and differentiation. Models of volatile loss through localized eruptive degassing are not consistent with the available S, Cl, Zn and K isotopes and abundance data for the Moon. The most probable cause of volatile depletion is global-scale evaporation resulting from a giant impact or a magma ocean phase where inefficient volatile loss during magmatic convection led to the present distribution of volatile elements within mantle and crustal reservoirs. Problems exist for models of planetary volatile depletion following giant impact. Most critically, in this model, the volatile loss requires preferential delivery and retention of late-accreted volatiles to the Earth compared with the Moon. Different proportions of late-accreted mass are computed to explain present-day distributions of volatile and moderately volatile elements (e.g. Pb, Zn; 5 to {\textgreater}10{\%}) relative to highly siderophile elements (approx. 0.5{\%}) for the Earth. Models of early magma ocean phases may be more effective in explaining the volatile loss. Basaltic materials (e.g. eucrites and angrites) from highly differentiated airless asteroids are volatile-depleted, like the Moon, whereas the Earth and Mars have proportionally greater volatile contents. Parent-body size and the existence of early atmospheres are therefore likely to represent fundamental controls on planetary volatile retention or loss.},

Behind such hypotheses lies the assumption that planetary atmospheres steadily gain components. However, not only can gases enter atmospheres; they may also be lost from atmospheres both by adsorption into the planetary interior and by loss into space as a result of collisions with minor and major planetesimals. In this paper a necessarily qualitative discussion is given of the problem of collisions with minor planetesimals, a process called atmospheric cratering or atmospheric erosion, and a discussion is given of atmospheric loss accompanying collision of a planet with a major planetesimal, such as may have produced the Earth's Moon.},

Their atmospheres on the other hand have significant differences. Venus has the densest atmosphere, composed of CO2 mainly, with atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface 92 times that of the Earth, while Mars has the thinnest atmosphere, composed also essentially of CO2, with only several millibars of atmospheric surface pressure. In the past, both Mars and Venus could have possessed Earth-like climate permitting the presence of surface liquid water reservoirs. Impacts by asteroids and comets could have played a significant role in the evolution of the early atmospheres of the Earth, Mars, and Venus, not only by causing atmospheric erosion but also by delivering material and volatiles to the planets. Here we investigate the atmospheric loss and the delivery of volatiles for the three terrestrial planets using a parameterized model that takes into account the impact simulation results and the flux of impactors given in the literature. We show that the dimensions of the planets, the initial atmospheric surface pressures and the volatiles contents of the impactors are of high importance for the impact delivery and erosion, and that they might be responsible for the differences in the atmospheric evolution of Mars, Earth and Venus.},

abstract = {Geochemical evidence suggests that the material accreted by the Earth did not change in nature during Earth's accretion, presumably because the inner protoplanetary disc had uniform isotopic composition similar to enstatite chondrites, aubrites and ungrouped achondrite NWA 5363/5400. Enstatite meteorites and the Earth were derived from the same nebular reservoir but diverged in their chemical evolutions, so no chondrite sample in meteorite collections is representative of the Earth's building blocks. The similarity in isotopic composition ($\Delta$(17)O, $\epsilon$(50)Ti and $\epsilon$(54)Cr) between lunar and terrestrial rocks is explained by the fact that the Moon-forming impactor came from the same region of the disc as other Earth-forming embryos, and therefore was similar in isotopic composition to the Earth. The heavy $\delta$(30)Si values of the silicate Earth and the Moon relative to known chondrites may be due to fractionation in the solar nebula/protoplanetary disc rather than partitioning of silicon in Earth's core. An inversion method is presented to calculate the Hf/W ratios and $\epsilon$(182)W values of the proto-Earth and impactor mantles for a given Moon-forming impact scenario. The similarity in tungsten isotopic composition between lunar and terrestrial rocks is a coincidence that can be explained in a canonical giant impact scenario if an early formed embryo (two-stage model age of 10-20 Myr) collided with the proto-Earth formed over a more protracted accretion history (two-stage model age of 30-40 Myr).},

abstract = {A new model for terrestrial planet formation (Hansen [2009]. Astrophys. J., 703, 1131–1140; Walsh, K.J., et al. [2011]. Nature, 2011, 206–209) has explored accretion in a truncated protoplanetary disk, and found that such a configuration is able to reproduce the distribution of mass among the planets in the Solar System, especially the Earth/Mars mass ratio, which earlier simulations have generally not been able to match. Walsh et al. (Walsh, K.J., et al. [2011]. Nature, 2011, 206–209) tested a possible mechanism to truncate the disk—a two-stage, inward-then-outward migration of Jupiter and Saturn, as found in numerous hydrodynamical simulations of giant planet formation. In addition to truncating the disk and producing a more realistic Earth/Mars mass ratio, the migration of the giant planets also populates the asteroid belt with two distinct populations of bodies—the inner belt is filled by bodies originating inside of 3AU, and the outer belt is filled with bodies originating from between and beyond the giant planets (which are hereafter referred to as ‘primitive' bodies). One implication of the truncation mechanism proposed in Walsh et al. (Walsh, K.J., et al. [2011]. Nature, 2011, 206–209) is the scattering of primitive planetesimals onto planet-crossing orbits during the formation of the planets. We find here that the planets will accrete on order 1–2{\%} of their total mass from these bodies. For an assumed value of 10{\%} for the water mass fraction of the primitive planetesimals, this model delivers a total amount of water comparable to that estimated to be on the Earth today. The radial distribution of the planetary masses and the dynamical excitation of their orbits are a good match to the observed system. However, we find that a truncated disk leads to formation timescales more rapid than suggested by radiometric chronometers. In particular, the last giant impact is typically earlier than 20Myr, and a substantial amount of mass is accreted after that event. This is at odds with the dating of the Moon-forming impact and the estimated amount of mass accreted by Earth following that event. However, 5 of the 27 planets larger than half an Earth mass formed in all simulations do experience large late impacts and subsequent accretion consistent with those constraints.},

abstract = {The present study is focused on viscouslike behavior of solids during large‐amplitude compressive stress‐wave propagation. Maximum strain rate in the plastic wave has been determined for 30 steady‐ or near steady‐wave profiles obtained with velocity interferometry methods. The materials include six metals, aluminum, beryllium, bismuth, copper, iron, and uranium, and two insulating solids, magnesium oxide and fused silica. A plot of Hugoniot stress versus maximum strain rate for each material is adequately described by $\eta$̇=a$\sigma$ m h . The exponent m is approximately 4 for all materials while the coefficient a is material dependent. A model is developed which incorporates the observed trends of the shock viscosity data in a three‐dimensional framework. Finite‐difference calculations using the model reproduce the experimental wave profile data.},

abstract = {The outcome of collisions between small icy bodies, such as Kuiper belt objects, is poorly understood and yet a critical component of the evolution of the trans-neptunian region. The expected physical properties of outer Solar System materials (high porosity, mixed ice–rock composition, and low material strength) pose significant computational challenges. We present results from catastrophic small body collisions using a new hybrid hydrocode to N-body code computational technique. This method allows detailed modeling of shock propagation and material modification as well as gravitational reaccumulation. Here, we consider a wide range of material strengths to span the possible range of Kuiper belt objects. We find that the shear strength of the target is important in determining the collision outcome for 2 to 50-km radius bodies, which are traditionally thought to be in a pure gravity regime. The catastrophic disruption and dispersal criteria, QD∗, can vary by up to a factor of three between strong crystalline and weak aggregate materials. The material within the largest reaccumulated remnants experiences a wide range of shock pressures. The dispersal and reaccumulation process results in the material on the surfaces of the largest remnants having experienced a wider range of shock pressures compared to material in the interior. Hence, depending on the initial structure and composition, the surface materials on large, reaccumulated bodies in the outer Solar System may exhibit complex spectral and albedo variations. Finally, we present revised catastrophic disruption criteria for a range of impact velocities and material strengths for outer Solar System bodies.},

abstract = {We present conclusions from a large number of N-body simulations of the giant impact phase of terrestrial planet formation. We focus on new results obtained from the recently proposed Grand Tack model, which couples the gas-driven migration of giant planets to the accretion of the terrestrial planets. The giant impact phase follows the oligarchic growth phase, which builds a bi-modal mass distribution within the disc of embryos and planetesimals. By varying the ratio of the total mass in the embryo population to the total mass in the planetesimal population and the mass of the individual embryos, we explore how different disc conditions control the final planets. The total mass ratio of embryos to planetesimals controls the timing of the last giant (Moon forming) impact and its violence. The initial embryo mass sets the size of the lunar impactor and the growth rate of Mars. After comparing our simulated outcomes with the actual orbits of the terrestrial planets (angular momentum deficit, mass concentration) and taking into account independent geochemical constraints on the mass accreted by the Earth after the Moon forming event and on the timescale for the growth of Mars, we conclude that the protoplanetary disc at the beginning of the giant impact phase must have had most of its mass in Mars-sized embryos and only a small fraction of the total disc mass in the planetesimal population. From this, we infer that the Moon forming event occurred between {\$}\backslashsim{\$}60 and {\$}\backslashsim{\$}130 My after the formation of the first solids, and was caused most likely by an object with a mass similar to that of Mars.},

Variations in volatile contents among these bodies, therefore, did not result from accretion at different times from an incompletely condensed solar nebula but must reflect local processes within the nebula.},

abstract = {It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well-known example. In the aftermath of such collisions, the surface of the surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO2 and H2O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere, and oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that these atmospheres are dominated by H2O and CO2, while the formation of CH4 and NH3 is quenched because of short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO2. These are apparent in the emerging spectra and can be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor of two lower brightness temperature in the spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30 m class telescopes. The 1-4 $\mu$m will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive cooling timescales on the order of 105-6 yr on the basis of the modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.},

@article{Robinson2014,
abstract = {Initial analyses of lunar samples returned by the Apollo missions indicated that the Moon was essentially devoid of water. However, improved analytical techniques have revealed that pyroclastic glass beads in Apollo samples contain measurable amounts of water. Taking into account volatile loss during eruption of the glass beads onto the surface, the pre-eruption magma could have contained water on the order of 100 ppm by weight, concentrations that are similar to the mantle sources of mid-ocean ridge basalts on Earth. Lava flows from vast basaltic plains [mdash] the lunar maria [mdash] also contain appreciable amounts of water, as shown by analyses of apatite in mare basalt samples. In contrast, apatite in most non-mare rocks contains much less water than the mare basalts and glass beads. The hydrogen isotopic composition of lunar samples is relatively similar to that of the Earth's interior, but the deuterium to hydrogen ratios obtained from lunar samples seem to have a larger range than found in Earth's mantle. Thus, measurements of water concentration and hydrogen isotopic composition suggest that water is heterogeneously distributed in the Moon and varies in isotopic composition. The variability in the Moon's water may reflect heterogeneity in accretion processes, redistribution during differentiation or later additions by volatile-rich impactors.},

With this configuration, analogs of Mercury and Mars often form from the collisional evolution of material diffusing out of the annulus under the scattering of the forming Earth and Venus analogs. The final systems also possess eccentricities and inclinations that match the observations, without recourse to dynamical friction from remnant small body populations. Finally, the characteristic assembly timescale for Earth analogs is rapid in this model and consistent with cosmochemical models based on the 182Hf-182W isotopes. The agreement between this model and the observations suggests that terrestrial planet systems may also be formed in planet traps, as has been proposed recently for the cores of giant planets in our solar system and others.},

We measured the chlorine isotope composition of Apollo basalts and glasses and found that the range of isotopic values [from -1 to +24 per mil (per thousand) versus standard mean ocean chloride] is 25 times the range for Earth. The huge isotopic spread is explained by volatilization of metal halides during basalt eruption--a process that could only occur if the Moon had hydrogen concentrations lower than those of Earth by a factor of approximately 10(4) to 10(5), implying that the lunar interior is essentially anhydrous.},

Purified potassium is chemically extracted from rocks, soils, minerals, or solutions by ion exchange chromatography. Complete chemical yields ({\textgreater}99.8{\%}) are achieved in order to avoid laboratory-induced isotopic fractionations. The purified potassium is converted to a glass by melting with barium borate flux, and the resultant bead is mounted for ion probe analysis. The SIMS method utilized by the ion probe produces extremely stable K+ ion beams, with no measurable temporal variability in the isotope ratio. The instrumental fractionation is steady at about −4‰, and is corrected for by measurement of a standard. The measurement of gravimetrically prepared isotopic standards indicates that the method is accurate at the stated level of precision and free of egregious errors. Analysis of terrestrial samples including peridotite, basalts, granites, carbonatite, biotite schists, and seawater, indicate the complete absence of isotopic variations in $\delta$41 1K among terrestrial materials at the 0.5{\%}o level. Application to lunar soils and a regolith breccia confirms previously observed large isotopic fractionation effects (Garner et al., 1975a; Church et al., 1976). Some lunar soils, e.g., 14163, are shown to have large sample heterogeneity (≈7{\%}o), while others, e.g., soils and a regolith breccia at several Apollo 15 sites (Station 79), are homogeneous at the level of analytical precision. The presence of potassium isotopic effects in bulk soils (up to +12.7‰ in this study) with magnitudes comparable to the Rayleigh fractionation factor (25‰) indicates that volatility during micrometeorite impact melting played a large role in lunar regolith formation. As much as 15{\%} of the regolith potassium has been lost from the Moon, through the tenuous lunar atmosphere.},

abstract = {We report high precision (±0.5{\%}o) potassium isotopic determinations on bulk chondrites, achondrites, and lunar samples, on a separated chondrule, and two CAls. We find that potassium shows a remarkable isotopic homogeneity in various solar system bodies, even though there are chemical depletions of a factor of about 30, between C1 chondrites and eucrites and lunar samples. Theories that propose the evaporation of volatile elements from initially condensed (C1 chondrite) material to account for such chemical depletions, necessarily imply the existence of large isotopic mass fractionations, e.g., about +40{\%}o for Earth, +90{\%}o for eucrites and lunar rocks. Volatile loss of potassium (and by implication Na, Rb, Cs, and other elements of similar volatility) during chondrule formation is also ruled out. The high precision of the data place stringent limits of ≤52{\%} on the quantity of potassium that could have been lost by partial volatilization. This is not detectable by standard chemical techniques, which can resolve 5–20{\%} changes in the K/La and K/U ratios. The two-component models proposed by Larimer and Anders (1967) and by W{\"{a}}nke et al. (1984) invoke vaporization of alkalis which is not supported by the potassium isotope results. The chemical depletion of alkalis and other volatiles must have preceded the processes of chondrule, chondrite, and planetary formation, and occurred during the condensation of precursor dust, probably from a hot stage in the solar nebula.},

abstract = {Earth is the one known example of an inhabited planet and to current knowledge the likeliest site of the one known origin of life. Here we discuss the origin of Earth's atmosphere and ocean and some of the environmental conditions of the early Earth as they may relate to the origin of life. A key punctuating event in the narrative is the Moon-forming impact, partly because it made Earth for a short time absolutely uninhabitable, and partly because it sets the boundary conditions for Earth's subsequent evolution. If life began on Earth, as opposed to having migrated here, it would have done so after the Moon-forming impact. What took place before the Moon formed determined the bulk properties of the Earth and probably determined the overall compositions and sizes of its atmospheres and oceans. What took place afterward animated these materials. One interesting consequence of the Moon-forming impact is that the mantle is devolatized, so that the volatiles subsequently fell out in a kind of condensation sequence. This ensures that the volatiles were concentrated toward the surface so that, for example, the oceans were likely salty from the start. We also point out that an atmosphere generated by impact degassing would tend to have a composition reflective of the impacting bodies (rather than the mantle), and these are almost without exception strongly reducing and volatile-rich. A consequence is that, although CO- or methane-rich atmospheres are not necessarily stable as steady states, they are quite likely to have existed as long-lived transients, many times. With CO comes abundant chemical energy in a metastable package, and with methane comes hydrogen cyanide and ammonia as important albeit less abundant gases.},

abstract = {Volatile elements have a fundamental role in the evolution of planets. But how budgets of volatiles were set in planets, and the nature and extent of volatile-depletion of planetary bodies during the earliest stages of Solar System formation remain poorly understood. The Moon is considered to be volatile-depleted and so it has been predicted that volatile loss should have fractionated stable isotopes of moderately volatile elements. One such element, zinc, exhibits strong isotopic fractionation during volatilization in planetary rocks, but is hardly fractionated during terrestrial igneous processes, making it a powerful tracer of the volatile histories of planets. Here we present high-precision zinc isotopic and abundance data which show that lunar magmatic rocks are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc and have lower zinc concentrations than terrestrial or Martian igneous rocks. Conversely, Earth and Mars have broadly chondritic zinc isotopic compositions. We show that these variations represent large-scale evaporation of zinc, most probably in the aftermath of the Moon-forming event, rather than small-scale evaporation processes during volcanism. Our results therefore represent evidence for volatile depletion of the Moon through evaporation, and are consistent with a giant impact origin for the Earth and Moon.},

abstract = {CTH is a software system under development at Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque to model multidimensional, multi-material, large deformation, strong shock wave physics. One-dimensional recti-linear, cylindrical, and spherical meshes; two-dimensional rectangular, and cylindrical meshes; and three-dimensional rectangular meshes are currently available. A two-step Eulerian solution scheme is used with these meshes. The first step is a Lagrangian step in which the cells distort to follow the material motion. The second step is a remesh step where the distorted cells are mapped back to the Eulerian mesh. CTH has several models that are useful for simulating strong shock, large deformation events. Both tabular and analytic equations of state are available. CTH can model elastic-plastic behavior, high explosive detonation, fracture, and motion of fragments smaller than a computational cell. The elastic-plastic model is elastic-perfectly plastic with thermal softening. A programmed burn model is available for modelling high explosive detonation. The Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state is available for modelling high explosive reaction products. Fracture can be initiated based on pressure or principle stress. A special model is available for moving fragments smaller than a computational cell with statistically the correct velocity. This model is very useful for analyzing fragmentation experiments and experiments with witness plates. CTH has been carefully designed to minimize the dispersion present in Eulerian codes. It has a high-resolution interface tracker that prevents breakup and distortion of material interfaces. It uses second order convection schemes to flux all quantities between cells. This paper describes the models, and novel features of CTH. Special emphasis will be placed on the features that are novel to CTH or are not direct generalizations of two-dimensional models. Another paper by Trucano and McGlaun (1989) describes several hypervelocity impact calculations using CTH.},

abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5×107 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

In this paper I review some of the current models of terrestrial planet accretion, and discuss assumptions common to most works that may require re-examination. Density-wave interactions between growing planets and the gas nebula may help to explain the current near-circular orbits of the Earth and Venus, and may result in large-scale radial migration of proto-planetary embryos. Migration would weaken the link between the present locations of the planets and the original provenance of the material that formed them. Fragmentation can potentially lead to faster accretion and could also damp final planet orbital eccentricities. The Moon-forming impact is believed to be the final major event in the Earth's accretion. Successful simulations of lunar-forming impacts involve a differentiated impactor containing between 0.1 and 0.2 Earth masses, an impact angle near 45 degrees and an impact speed within 10 per cent of the Earth's escape velocity. All successful impacts-with or without pre-impact rotation-imply that the Moon formed primarily from material originating from the impactor rather than from the proto-Earth. This must ultimately be reconciled with compositional similarities between the Earth and the Moon.},

abstract = {The energy associated with giant impacts is large enough to generate global magma oceans during Earth's accretion. However, geochemical evidence requiring a terrestrial magma ocean is scarce. Here we present evidence for at least two separate magma ocean outgassing episodes on Earth based on the ratio of primordial 3He to 22Ne in the present-day mantle. We demonstrate that the depleted mantle 3He/22Ne ratio is at least 10 while a more primitive mantle reservoir has a 3He/22Ne ratio of 2.3 to 3. The 3He/22Ne ratios of the mantle reservoirs are higher than possible sources of terrestrial volatiles, including the solar nebula ratio of 1.5. Therefore, a planetary process must have raised the mantle's 3He/22Ne ratio. We show that long-term plate tectonic cycling is incapable of raising the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio and may even lower it. However, ingassing of a gravitationally accreted nebular atmosphere into a magma ocean on the proto-Earth explains the 3He/22Ne and 20Ne/22Ne ratios of the primitive mantle reservoir. Increasing the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio to a value of 10 in the depleted mantle requires at least two episodes of atmospheric blow-off and magma ocean outgassing associated with giant impacts during subsequent terrestrial accretion. The preservation of a low 3He/22Ne ratio in a primitive reservoir sampled by plumes suggests that the later giant impacts, including the Moon-forming giant impact, did not generate a whole mantle magma ocean. Atmospheric loss episodes associated with giant impacts provide an explanation for Earth's subchondritic C/H, N/H, and Cl/F elemental ratios while preserving chondritic isotopic ratios. If so, a significant proportion of terrestrial water and potentially other major volatiles were accreted prior to the last giant impact, otherwise the fractionated elemental ratios would have been overprinted by the late veneer.},

abstract = {The composition and evolution of the silicate Earth during Hadean/Eoarchean times are widely debated and largely unknown due to the sparse geological record preserved from Earthʼs infancy. The short-lived 146Sm–142Nd chronometer applied to 3.8–3.7 Ga old mantle-derived amphibolites from the Isua Supracrustal Belt (ISB) in southwest Greenland has revealed ubiquitous 142Nd excesses in these rocks compared to modern samples and terrestrial Nd standards. Because the parent isotope, 146Sm, was extant only during the first few hundred million years of Solar System history, this implies derivation of the Greenland samples from a source formed in the Hadean. This mantle source is the oldest yet identified on Earth and therefore provides key information about the nature and evolution of early-differentiated reservoirs. In contrast, modern mantle-derived rocks from around the world do not have 142Nd anomalies, suggesting that the primordial heterogeneities detected in Earthʼs early mantle have been erased over time. In order to better constrain the rate at which early mantle heterogeneities have been re-homogenized, we produced new 146Sm–142Nd data for both 3.8 and 3.3 Ga old mafic rocks from different tectonic domains of the ISB, accompanied by their corresponding 147Sm–143Nd and 176Lu–176Hf systematics. The 3.8 Ga suite yields 142Nd excesses comparable to those detected previously in 3.7 Ga old ISB amphibolites, indicating that Eoarchean mafic ISB lavas originated from sources with similar differentiation histories despite being from different juxtaposed tectonic segments. Conversely, 3.3 Ga old amphibolites from the ISB do not show resolvable 142Nd anomalies compared to terrestrial Nd standards. Since Rizo et al. (2012) reported 142Nd anomalies in 3.4 Ga old ISB samples, the present data suggest that the primordial 142Nd heterogeneities in the Isua mantle disappeared between 3.4 and 3.3 Ga. The present data set consists of samples from a unique location where 500 million years of history of the early terrestrial mantle have been preserved, hence offering an exceptional opportunity to gain new insight into the compositional evolution and dynamic workings of Earthʼs primordial mantle.},

The model atmosphere has a gray infrared absorption coefficient and is composed of a radiative equilibrium stratosphere and a moist adiabat troposphere. An upper limit of the outgoing infrared radiation is found to exist. The existence of the upper limit is characterized by the radiation limits that appear when the optical depth of the entire atmosphere becomes sufficiently deep and the temperature structure around the levels where the optical depth is about unity approaches a fixed profile. This appearance of an upper limit differs from that found by Komabayashi and Ingersoll, which is obtained from the constraint of the stratospheric radiation balance.

abstract = {Siderophile elements are depleted in the Earth's mantle, relative to chondritic meteorites, as a result of equilibration with core-forming Fe-rich metal. Measurements of metal-silicate partition coefficients show that mantle depletions of slightly siderophile elements (e.g. Cr, V) must have occurred at more reducing conditions than those inferred from the current mantle FeO content. This implies that the oxidation state (i.e. FeO content) of the mantle increased with time as accretion proceeded. The oxygen fugacity of the present-day upper mantle is several orders of magnitude higher than the level imposed by equilibrium with core-forming Fe metal. This results from an increase in the Fe2O3 content of the mantle that probably occurred in the first 1Ga of the Earth's history. Here we explore fractionation mechanisms that could have caused mantle FeO and Fe2O3 contents to increase while the oxidation state of accreting material remained constant (homogeneous accretion). Using measured metal-silicate partition coefficients for O and Si, we have modelled core-mantle equilibration in a magma ocean that became progressively deeper as accretion proceeded. The model indicates that the mantle would have become gradually oxidized as a result of Si entering the core. However, the increase in mantle FeO content and oxygen fugacity is limited by the fact that O also partitions into the core at high temperatures, which lowers the FeO content of the mantle. (Mg,Fe)(Al,Si)O3 perovskite, the dominant lower mantle mineral, has a strong affinity for Fe2O3 even in the presence of metallic Fe. As the upper mantle would have been poor in Fe2O3 during core formation, FeO would have disproportionated to produce Fe2O3 (in perovskite) and Fe metal. Loss of some disproportionated Fe metal to the core would have enriched the remaining mantle in Fe2O3 and, if the entire mantle was then homogenized, the oxygen fugacity of the upper mantle would have been raised to its present-day level.},

abstract = {In the core accretion model for giant planet formation, a solid core forms by coagulation of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk and then accretes gas from the disk when the core reaches a critical mass. Both stages must be completed in a few million years before the disk gas disperses. The slowest stage of this process may be oligarchic growth in which a giant-planet core grows by sweeping up smaller, asteroid-size planetesimals. Here, we describe new numerical simulations of oligarchic growth using a particle-in-a-box model. The simulations include several processes that can effect oligarchic growth: (i) planetesimal fragmentation due to mutual collisions, (ii) the modified capture rate of planetesimals due to a core's atmosphere, (iii) drag with the disk gas during encounters with the core (so-called “pebble accretion”), (iv) modification of particle velocities by turbulence and drift caused by gas drag, (v) the presence of a population of mm-to-m size “pebbles” that represent the transition point between disruptive collisions between larger particles, and mergers between dust grains, and (vi) radial drift of small objects due to gas drag. Collisions between planetesimals rapidly generate a population of pebbles. The rate at which a core sweeps up pebbles is controlled by pebble accretion dynamics. Metre-size pebbles lose energy during an encounter with a core due to drag, and settle towards the core, greatly increasing the capture probability during a single encounter. Millimetre-size pebbles are tightly coupled to the gas and most are swept past the core during an encounter rather than being captured. Accretion efficiency per encounter increases with pebble size in this size range. However, radial drift rates also increase with size, so metre-size objects encounter a core on many fewer occasions than mm-size pebbles before they drift out of a region. The net result is that core growth rates vary weakly with pebble size, with the optimal diameter being about 10cm. The main effect of planetesimal size is to determine the rate of mutual collisions, fragment production and the formation of pebbles. 1-km-diameter planetesimals collide frequently and have low impact strengths, leading to a large surface density of pebbles and rapid core growth via pebble accretion. 100-km-diameter planetesimals produce fewer pebbles, and pebble accretion plays a minor role in this case. The strength of turbulence in the gas determines the scale height of pebbles in the disk, which affects the rate at which they are accreted. For an initial solid surface density of12g/cm2 at 5AU, with 10-cm diameter pebbles and a disk viscosity parameter $\alpha$=10-4, a 10-Earth mass core can form in 3My for 1–10km diameter planetesimals. The growth of such a core requires longer than 3My if planetesimals are 100km in diameter.},

abstract = {The agglomeration of planetary embryos and planetesimals was the final stage of terrestrial planet formation. This process is modeled using N-body accretion simulations, whose outcomes are tested by comparing to observed physical and chemical Solar System properties. The outcomes of these simulations are stochastic, leading to a wide range of results, which makes it difficult at times to identify the full range of possible outcomes for a given dynamic environment. We ran fifty high-resolution simulations each with Jupiter and Saturn on circular or eccentric orbits, whereas most previous studies ran an order of magnitude fewer. This allows us to better quantify the probabilities of matching various observables, including low probability events such as Mars formation, and to search for correlations between properties. We produce many good Earth analogues, which provide information about the mass evolution and provenance of the building blocks of the Earth. Most observables are weakly correlated or uncorrelated, implying that individual evolutionary stages may reflect how the system evolved even if models do not reproduce all of the Solar System's properties at the end. Thus individual N-body simulations may be used to study the chemistry of planetary accretion as particular accretion pathways may be representative of a given dynamic scenario even if that simulation fails to reproduce many of the other observed traits of the Solar System.},

@article{Deguen2014,
abstract = {Much of the Earth was built by high-energy impacts of planetesimals and embryos, many of these impactors already differentiated, with metallic cores of their own. Geochemical data provide critical information on the timing of accretion and the prevailing physical conditions, but their interpretation depends critically on the degree of metal–silicate chemical equilibration during core–mantle differentiation, which is poorly constrained. Efficient equilibration requires that the large volumes of iron derived from impactor cores mix with molten silicates down to scales small enough to allow fast metal–silicate mass transfer. Here we use fluid dynamics experiments to show that large metal blobs falling in a magma ocean mix with the molten silicate through turbulent entrainment, with fragmentation into droplets eventually resulting from the entrainment process. In our experiments, fragmentation of the dense fluid occurs after falling a distance equal to 3–4 times its initial diameter, at which point a sizable volume of ambient fluid has already been entrained and mixed with the dense falling fluid. Contrary to previous assumptions, we demonstrate that fragmentation of the metallic phase into droplets may not be required for efficient equilibration: turbulent mixing, by drastically increasing the metal–silicate interfacial area, may result in fast equilibration even before fragmentation. Efficient re-equilibration is predicted for impactors of size small compared to the magma ocean depth. In contrast, much less re-equilibration is predicted for large impacts in situations where the impactor core diameter approaches the magma ocean thickness.},

abstract = {The recent discoveries of hydrogen (H) bearing species on the lunar surface and in samples derived from the lunar interior have necessitated a paradigm shift in our understanding of the water inventory of the Moon, which was previously considered to be a ‘bone-dry' planetary body. Most sample-based studies have focused on assessing the water contents of the younger mare basalts and pyroclastic glasses, which are partial-melting products of the lunar mantle. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the inventory and source(s) of water in the lunar highlands rocks which are some of the oldest and most pristine materials available for laboratory investigations, and that have the potential to reveal the original history of water in the Earth–Moon system. Here, we report in-situ measurements of hydroxyl (OH) content and H isotopic composition of the mineral apatite from four lunar highlands samples (two norites, a troctolite, and a granite clast) collected during the Apollo missions. Apart from troctolite in which the measured OH contents in apatite are close to our analytical detection limit and its H isotopic composition appears to be severely compromised by secondary processes, we have measured up to ∼2200 ppm OH in the granite clast with a weighted average $\delta$D of ∼−105±130‰, and up to ∼3400 ppm OH in the two norites (77215 and 78235) with weighted average $\delta$D values of −281±49‰ and −27±98‰, respectively. The apatites in the granite clast and the norites are characterised by higher OH contents than have been reported so far for highlands samples, and have H isotopic compositions similar to those of terrestrial materials and some carbonaceous chondrites, providing one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet for a common origin for water in the Earth–Moon system. In addition, the presence of water, of terrestrial affinity, in some samples of the earliest-formed lunar crust suggests that either primordial terrestrial water survived the aftermath of the putative impact-origin of the Moon or water was added to the Earth–Moon system by a common source immediately after the accretion of the Moon.},

abstract = {The two convective systems that dominate Earthʼs internal dynamics meet at the boundary between the rocky mantle and metallic liquid core. Energy transfer between processes driving plate tectonics and the geodynamo is controlled by thermal conduction in the lowermost mantle (D″). We use atomic scale simulations to determine the thermal conductivity of MgSiO3 perovskite and post-perovskite under D″ conditions and probe how these two convective systems interact. We show that the thermal conductivity of post-perovskite (∼12 W/mK) is 50{\%} larger than that of perovskite under the same conditions (∼8.5 W/mK) and is anisotropic, with conductivity along the a-axis being 40{\%} higher than conductivity along the c-axis. This enhances the high heat flux into cold regions of D″ where post-perovskite is stable, strengthening the feedback between convection in the core and mantle. Reminiscent of the situation in the lithosphere, there is potential for deformation induced texturing associated with mantle convection to modify how the mantle is heated from below. We test this by coupling our atomic scale results to models of texture in D″ and suggest that anisotropic thermal conductivity may help to stabilise the roots of mantle plumes over their protracted lifetime.},

abstract = {The timescales of accretion, core formation, and magmatic differentiation in planetary bodies can be constrained using extinct radionuclide systems. Experiments have shown that Ni becomes more siderophile with decreasing pressure, which is reflected in the progressively higher Fe/Ni ratios in the mantles of Earth, Mars and Vesta. Mars formed rapidly and its mantle has a high Fe/Ni ratio, so the 60Fe–60Ni decay system (t1/2=2.62 Myr) is well suited to establish the timescale of core formation in this object. We report new measurements of 60Ni/58Ni ratios in bulk SNC/martian (Shergotty–Nakhla–Chassigny) meteorites and chondrites. The difference in $\epsilon$Ni60 values between SNC meteorites and the building blocks of Mars assumed to be chondritic (55{\%} ordinary chondrites + 45{\%} enstatite chondrites) is +0.028±0.023 (95{\%} confidence interval). Using a model of growth of planetary embryo, this translates into a time for Mars to have reached ∼44{\%} of its present size of 1.9−0.8+1.7 Myr with a strict lower limit of 1.2 Myr after solar system formation, which agrees with a previous estimate based on 182Hf–182W systematics. The presence of Mars when planetesimals were still being formed may have influenced the formation of chondrules through bow shocks or by inducing collisions between dynamically excited planetesimals.},

abstract = {Partitioning of sulphur between liquid Fe-rich metals and silicates (DSmet/sil) was investigated at temperatures from 1800 °C to 2400 °C, pressures from 2 to 23 GPa and oxygen fugacities from 3.5 to 1.5 log units below the iron–w{\"{u}}stite buffer, using multi-anvil apparatus. The results are combined with previous experimental works to refine a multi-variable thermodynamic model of DSmet/sil. Sulphur appears to become more siderophile with increasing pressure and FeO content of the silicate melt, and less siderophile with increasing temperature and with Si, C, O, Fe and Ni contents of the metal. We then modelled the behaviour of sulphur in the course of planetary accretion, using different possible scenarios of mantle dynamics and evolution with time of oxygen fugacity. We investigated three end-member models for metal–silicate segregation of the incoming impactors: (i) the planetary mantle does not mix and is kept chemically stratified, (ii) the magma ocean is continuously mixed chemically, and (iii) both the magma ocean and the solid lower mantle are well mixed. We show that if S is accreted along the accretion, whatever the oxidation path, its distribution between core and mantle can lead to the observed S concentration of the mantle (200±80 ppm) and to the estimations of S content of the core (from its depletion in the mantle relative to the other elements with the same volatility). In the case of an Earth built with reduced material, to explain the present-day 200(±80) ppm S found in the mantle, it is necessary that both the magma ocean and the solid lower mantle mix at each major step of the planetary accretion. S could also be accreted in the last 10 to 20{\%} of Earthʼs growth and reach its observed present terrestrial abundances if the magma ocean is chemically mixed along the accretion. Consequently, our models show that the S terrestrial abundances do not formally require an S accretion in a late veneer but can be explained by a core–mantle equilibration alone.},

Because the lowermost mantle is not globally molten, this provides an upper bound of the temperature at the core-mantle boundary (TCMB). Such remarkably low TCMB implies that the post-perovskite phase is present in wide areas of the lowermost mantle. The low TCMB also requires that the melting temperature of the outer core is depressed largely by impurities such as hydrogen.},

abstract = {Transient heating events that formed calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and chondrules are fundamental processes in the evolution of the solar protoplanetary disk, but their chronology is not understood. Using U-corrected Pb-Pb dating, we determined absolute ages of individual CAIs and chondrules from primitive meteorites. CAIs define a brief formation interval corresponding to an age of 4567.30 ± 0.16 million years (My), whereas chondrule ages range from 4567.32 ± 0.42 to 4564.71 ± 0.30 My. These data refute the long-held view of an age gap between CAIs and chondrules and, instead, indicate that chondrule formation started contemporaneously with CAIs and lasted {\~{}}3 My. This time scale is similar to disk lifetimes inferred from astronomical observations, suggesting that the formation of CAIs and chondrules reflects a process intrinsically linked to the secular evolution of accretionary disks.},

abstract = {Determining the origins of our solar system and, by proxy, other planetary systems, depends on knowing accurately and precisely the timing and tempo of the transformation of the disk of gas and dust to the solids that formed the planets. Relative ages based on the short-lived nuclide 26Al indicate that high-temperature calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) formed before lower temperature chondrules but these ages are heavily dependant on a model of homogeneous distribution of 26Al within the protoplanetary disk. The competing X-wind model argues for heterogeneous distribution of 26Al due to its formation by intra-solar system irradiation such that this system would have no chronological significance. We report a207Pb-206Pb isochron age of 4565.45 ± 0.45 Myr for chondrules from the CV chondrite Allende, an age that is 1.66 ± 0.48 Myr younger than the accepted Pb-Pb age for CAIs from this chondrite group. This age offset is in excellent agreement with the relative ages determined using the 26Al-26Mg system, an observation that supports a supernova origin for 26Al and, importantly, the chronological significance of the 26Al-26Mg system in general. This is consistent with an early and brief CAI-forming event followed by recurrent chondrule formation throughout the life span of the protoplanetary disk. The paucity of old chondrules in chondrite meteorites may reflect their early incorporation into the parent bodies of differentiated meteorites after CAIs were effectively removed from the innermost regions of the protoplanetary disk. Lastly, the agreement between the absolute and relative chronology of CAIs and chondrules requires a solar system age younger than {\~{}}4567.5 Myr},

abstract = {Models of terrestrial planet formation for our solar system have been successful in producing planets with masses and orbits similar to those of Venus and Earth. However, these models have generally failed to produce Mars-sized objects around 1.5 AU. The body that is usually formed around Mars' semimajor axis is, in general, much more massive than Mars. Only when Jupiter and Saturn are assumed to have initially very eccentric orbits (e {\~{}} 0.1), which seems fairly unlikely for the solar system, or alternately, if the protoplanetary disk is truncated at 1.0 AU, simulations have been able to produce Mars-like bodies in the correct location. In this paper, we examine an alternative scenario for the formation of Mars in which a local depletion in the density of the protosolar nebula results in a non-uniform formation of planetary embryos and ultimately the formation of Mars-sized planets around 1.5 AU. We have carried out extensive numerical simulations of the formation of terrestrial planets in such a disk for different scales of the local density depletion, and for different orbital configurations of the giant planets. Our simulations point to the possibility of the formation of Mars-sized bodies around 1.5 AU, specifically when the scale of the disk local mass-depletion is moderately high (50{\%}-75{\%}) and Jupiter and Saturn are initially in their current orbits. In these systems, Mars-analogs are formed from the protoplanetary materials that originate in the regions of disk interior or exterior to the local mass-depletion. Results also indicate that Earth-sized planets can form around 1 AU with a substantial amount of water accreted via primitive water-rich planetesimals and planetary embryos. We present the results of our study and discuss their implications for the formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system.},

abstract = {One of the continuing debates of outer Solar System research centers on the thickness of Europa's ice crust, as it affects both the habitability and accessibility of its sub-surface ocean. Here we use hydrocode modeling of the impact process in layered ice and water targets and comparison to Europan cratering trends and Galileo-derived topographic profiles to investigate the crustal thickness. Full or partial penetration of the ice crust by an impactor occurred in simulations in which the ice thickness was less than 14 times the projectile radius. Craters produced in these thin-shell simulations were consistently smaller than for larger ice thicknesses, which will complicate inference of large impactor population sizes. Simulations in which the resultant crater was 3 times the ice layer thickness resulted in summit-pit morphology. This work supports that summit pit craters noted on both rocky and icy bodies, can be created by the presence of a weaker layer at depth. We suggest that floor pits, seen only on ice-rich bodies, require a different formation mechanism to summit pits. Pristine craters formed in a target with high heat flow were shallower than for the same impact into a target of lesser heat flow, suggesting that the ‘starting' crater morphology for viscous relaxation, isostatic readjustments and erosion rate studies is different for craters formed in times of different heat flow. We find that the crater depth–diameter trend of Europa can only be recreated when simulating impact into an upper brittle ice layer of 7km depth, with a corresponding geothermal gradient of 0.025K/m. As this ice thickness estimate is below ∼10km, results from this work suggest that convective overturn of the surface ice may occur, or have occurred, on Europa making the development of indigenous life a possibility.},

abstract = {High abundances of short-lived radiogenic isotopes in the early solar system led to interior melting and differentiation on many of the first planetesimals. Petrologic, isotopic, and paleomagnetic evidence suggests that some differentiated planetesimals retained primitive chondritic material. The preservation of a cold chondritic lid depends on whether deep melts are able to ascend and breach the chondritic crust. We evaluate the likelihood of melt ascent on a range of chondritic parent bodies. We find that, due to the efficient ascent of free volatiles in the gas and supercritical fluid phases at temperatures still below the solidus for silicates and metals, mobile silicate melts on planetesimals were likely volatile-depleted. By calculating the densities of such melts, we show that silicate melts likely breached crusts of enstatite chondrite compositions but did not ascend in the CV and CM parent bodies. Ordinary chondrite melts represent an intermediate case. These predictions are consistent with paleomagnetic results from CV and CM chondrites as well as spectral observations of large E-type asteroids.},

abstract = {To understand how adiabatic compression influences mantle convection in super-Earths, we carried out linear stability analysis and non-linear numerical simulation of thermal convection for constant viscosity infinite Prandtl number fluid with both constant and pressure-dependent thermal expansivity. The mantle is basally heated and internal heating is not considered. In the case of constant thermal expansivity, thermal convection is totally inhibited in super-Earths of more than about 5 times the Earth's mass owing to the strong effect of adiabatic compression, when the surface temperature is sufficiently high. Pressure-dependence of thermal expansivity is crucial for the onset of convection in massive super-Earths. Even when the thermal expansivity depends on pressure, our numerical simulation shows that the effect of adiabatic compression reduces the efficiency of convective heat transport by up to about 60{\%}, depending on the planetary mass and the surface temperature. The reduction in the efficiency of convective heat transport makes cooling of the mantle more difficult in massive super-Earths, especially when the surface temperature is high. The surface temperature of a planet may affect its thermal history not only through its effects on the mechanical properties of convecting mantle materials, but also through its influence on adiabatic compression of convecting materials.},

abstract = {Until recently, the Moon had long been thought to be depleted of volatiles such as H2O, S, COx and Cl2. Researchers have recently measured volatile concentrations in the minerals, glasses and inclusions of lunar samples, and the results show that lunar rocks contain volatiles that are more similar to terrestrial materials than was previously thought. Mare basalts are located on the Earth-facing hemisphere in large impact basins, and they are not representative of the feldspathic highlands. Thus, it is likely that the density of lunar mafic magma exceeds that of the highland rocks based on buoyancy alone. According to this observational fact, we calculate the density of mare basalt to give a constraint for the maximum amount of water mare basalt can contain because water can effectively decrease the density of mare magma. Our result shows that water contained in the pre-eruptive magma could not have been more than 1000 ppm; otherwise, the density of very-low-Ti basaltic magma would be less than that of the highland rocks. Additionally, if magma contains other species of volatiles such as C-O, S, F, or Cl2, the water in the pre-eruptive magma would have to be much less than 1000 ppm because volatiles such as CO2 can effectively decrease the solubility of water in silicate melts. Based on these calculations on densities and a comparison with water in MORB, we conclude that the moon's water is not as great as has been recently suggested.},

abstract = {According to the standard giant impact hypothesis, the Moon formed from a partially vaporized disk generated by a collision between the proto Earth and a Mars sized impactor. The initial structure of the disk significantly affects the Moon forming process, including the Moons mass, its accretion time scale, and its isotopic similarity to Earth. The dynamics of the impact event determines the initial structure of a nearly hydrostatic Moon forming disk. However, the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models have been studied separately and their connection has not previously been well quantified. Here, we show the extent to which the properties of the disk can be inferred from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations. By using entropy, angular momentum and mass distributions of the SPH outputs as approximately conserved quantities, we compute the two dimensional disk structure. We investigate four different models: (a) standard, the canonical giant impact model, (b) fast spinning Earth, a collision between a fast spinning Earth and a small impactor, (c) sub Earths, a collision between two objects with half Earths mass, and (d) intermediate, a collision of two bodies whose mass ratio is 7:3. Our SPH calculations show that the initial disk has approximately uniform entropy. The disks of the fast spinning Earth and sub Earths cases are hotter and more vaporized (80-90{\%} vapor) than the standard case (20{\%}). The intermediate case falls between these values. In the highly vaporized cases, our procedure fails to establish a unique surface density profile of the disk because the disk is unstable according to the Rayleigh criterion. In these cases, we estimate non-unique disk models by conserving global quantities. We also develop a semi analytic model for the thermal structure of the disk, which requires only two inputs: the average entropy and the surface density of the disk.},

We model the gravitational accumulation of nebula gas around a core as a function of protoplanetary luminosity during accretion and calculate the resulting surface temperature by solving the hydrostatic structure equations for the protoplanetary nebula. Depending on nebular properties and resulting luminosities, for planetary bodies of 0.1--1{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} we obtain hydrogen envelopes with masses between {\$}\backslashsim 2.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}}{\$}--{\$}1.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}26{\}}{\$} g. For `super-Earths' with masses between 2--5{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashoplus{\}}{\$} hydrogen envelopes within the mass range of {\$}\backslashsim 7.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}23{\}}{\$}--{\$}1.5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}28{\}}{\$} g can be captured. To study the escape of these hydrogen-dominated protoatmospheres, we apply a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model and calculate the loss rates due to the heating by the high XUV flux of the young star. Our results indicate that under most nebula conditions `sub-Earth' and Earth-mass planets can lose their envelopes by thermal escape during the first {\$}100{\$} Myr after the disk dissipated. However, if a nebula has a low dust depletion factor or low accretion rates resulting in low protoplanetary luminosities, it is possible that even protoplanets with Earth-mass cores may keep their hydrogen envelopes during their whole lifetime. In contrast to lower mass protoplanets, `super-Earths' accumulate a huge amount of nebula gas and lose only tiny fractions of their primordial envelopes. Our results agree with the fact that Venus, Earth, and Mars are not surrounded by dense hydrogen envelopes, as well as with the recent discoveries of low density `super-Earths' that most likely could not get rid of their protoatmospheres.},

abstract = {Determination of an exoplanet's mass is a key to understanding its basic properties, including its potential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are predominantly based on radial velocity (RV) measurements, which are not suited for planets with low masses, large semimajor axes, or those orbiting faint or active stars. Here, we present a method to extract an exoplanet's mass solely from its transmission spectrum. We find good agreement between the mass retrieved for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b from transmission spectroscopy with that from RV measurements. Our method will be able to retrieve the masses of Earth-sized and super-Earth planets using data from future space telescopes that were initially designed for atmospheric characterization.},

Climate models that consider only the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and water have been unable to recreate warm surface conditions, given the lower solar luminosity at that time. Here we use a one-dimensional climate model to demonstrate that an atmosphere containing 1.3-4[thinsp]bar of CO2 and water, in addition to 5-20{\%} H2, could have raised the mean surface temperature of early Mars above the freezing point of water. Vigorous volcanic outgassing from a highly reduced early martian mantle is expected to provide sufficient atmospheric H2 and CO2[mdash]the latter from the photochemical oxidation of outgassed CH4 and CO[mdash]to form a CO2 and H2 greenhouse. Such a dense early martian atmosphere is consistent with independent estimates of surface pressure based on cratering data.},

Previous observations have indicated that its atmosphere has a ratio of methane to carbon monoxide that is 10(5) times smaller than predicted by models for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres at these temperatures. A recent study proposed that this unusual chemistry could be explained if the planet's atmosphere is significantly enhanced in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Here we report observations of GJ 436b's atmosphere obtained during transit. The data indicate that the planet's transmission spectrum is featureless, ruling out cloud-free, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere models with an extremely high significance of 48$\sigma$. The measured spectrum is consistent with either a layer of high cloud located at a pressure level of approximately one millibar or with a relatively hydrogen-poor (three per cent hydrogen and helium mass fraction) atmospheric composition.},

abstract = {Recent surveys have revealed that planets intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune ('super-Earths') are among the most common planets in the Galaxy. Atmospheric studies are the next step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of this new class of object. Much effort has been focused on using transmission spectroscopy to characterize the atmosphere of the super-Earth archetype GJ 1214b (refs 7 - 17), but previous observations did not have sufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for the atmosphere. The planet's atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavy molecules, such as water (for example, a 100 per cent water vapour composition), or it could contain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. Here we report a measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b at near-infrared wavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. The data, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorption features from a high mean-molecular-mass atmosphere. The observed spectrum, however, is featureless. We rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with compositions dominated by water, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen or carbon dioxide at greater than 5$\sigma$ confidence. The planet's atmosphere must contain clouds to be consistent with the data.},

abstract = {The composition of the lunar crust provides clues about the processes that formed it and hence contains information on the origin and evolution of the Moon. Current understanding of lunar evolution is built on the Lunar Magma Ocean hypothesis that early in its history, the Moon was wholly or mostly molten. This hypothesis is based on analyses of Apollo samples of ferroan anorthosites ({\textgreater}90{\%} plagioclase; molar Mg/(Mg+Fe)=Mg{\#}{\textless}75) and the assumption that they are globally distributed. However, new results from lunar meteorites, which are random samples of the Moonʼs surface, and remote sensing data, show that ferroan anorthosites are not globally distributed and that the Apollo highland samples, used as a basis for the model, are influenced by ejecta from the Imbrium basin. In this study we evaluate anorthosites from all currently available adequately described lunar highland meteorites, representing a more widespread sampling of the lunar highlands than Apollo samples alone, and find that ∼80{\%} of them are significantly more magnesian than Apollo ferroan anorthosites. Interestingly, Luna mission anorthosites, collected outside the continuous Imbrium ejecta, are also highly magnesian. If the lunar highland crust consists dominantly of magnesian anorthosites, as suggested by their abundance in samples sourced outside Imbrium ejecta, a reevaluation of the Lunar Magma Ocean model is a sensible step forward in the endeavor to understand lunar evolution. Our results demonstrate that lunar anorthosites are more similar in their chemical trends and mineral abundance to terrestrial massif anorthosites than to anorthosites predicted in a Lunar Magma Ocean. This analysis does not invalidate the idea of a Lunar Magma Ocean, which seems a necessity under the giant impact hypothesis for the origin of the moon. However, it does indicate that most rocks now seen at the Moonʼs surface are not primary products of a magma ocean alone, but are products of more complex crustal processes.},

abstract = {Analyses of Apollo era seismograms, lunar laser ranging data and the lunar moment of inertia suggest the presence of a small, at least partially molten Fe-rich metallic core in the Moon, but the chemical composition and formation conditions of this core are not well constrained. Here, we assess whether pressure–temperature conditions can be found at which the lunar silicate mantle equilibrated with a Fe-rich metallic liquid during core formation. To this end, we combine measurements of the metal–silicate partitioning behavior of siderophile elements with the estimated depletion due to core formation in those elements in the silicate mantle of the Moon. We also explore how the presence of the light element sulfur (suggested by seismic models to be present in the core at concentrations of up to 6 wt{\%}) in the lunar core affects core formation models. We use published metal–silicate partitioning data for Ni, Co, W, Mo, P, V and Cr in the lunar pressure range (1 atm–5 GPa) and characterize the dependence of the metal/silicate partition coefficients (D) on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity and composition of the silicate melt and the metal. If the core is assumed to consist of pure iron, core–mantle equilibration conditions that best satisfy lunar mantle depletions of five siderophile elements—Ni, Co, W, Mo and P—are a pressure of 4.5(±0.5) GPa and a temperature of 2200 K. The lunar mantle depletions of Cr and V are also consistent with metal–silicate equilibration in this pressure and temperature range if 6 wt{\%} S is incorporated into the lunar core. Our results therefore suggest that metal–silicate equilibrium during lunar core formation occurred at depths close to the present-day lunar core–mantle boundary. This provides independent support for both the existence of a deep magma ocean in the Moon in its early history and the presence of significant amounts of sulfur in the lunar core.},

abstract = {It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well known example. In the aftermath of such collisions the surface of the surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO2, and H2O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere and oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that these atmospheres are dominated by H2O and CO2, while the formation of CH4, and NH3 is quenched due to short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO2. These are apparent in the emerging spectra, and can be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor of 2 lower in surface brightness in the spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30m-class telescopes. The 1-4um region will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive cooling timescales on the order of 10{\^{}}5-10{\^{}}6 Myrs, based on the modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.},

abstract = {Volatiles are compounds with low sublimation temperatures, and they make up most of the condensible mass in typical planet-forming environments. They consist of relatively small, often hydrogenated, molecules based on the abundant elements carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Volatiles are central to the process of planet formation, forming the backbone of a rich chemistry that sets the initial conditions for the formation of planetary atmospheres, and act as a solid mass reservoir catalyzing the formation of planets and planetesimals. This growth has been driven by rapid advances in observations and models of protoplanetary disks, and by a deepening understanding of the cosmochemistry of the solar system. Indeed, it is only in the past few years that representative samples of molecules have been discovered in great abundance throughout protoplanetary disks - enough to begin building a complete budget for the most abundant elements after hydrogen and helium. The spatial distributions of key volatiles are being mapped, snow lines are directly seen and quantified, and distinct chemical regions within protoplanetary disks are being identified, characterized and modeled. Theoretical processes invoked to explain the solar system record are now being observationally constrained in protoplanetary disks, including transport of icy bodies and concentration of bulk condensibles. The balance between chemical reset - processing of inner disk material strong enough to destroy its memory of past chemistry, and inheritance - the chemically gentle accretion of pristine material from the interstellar medium in the outer disk, ultimately determines the final composition of pre-planetary matter. This chapter focuses on making the first steps toward understanding whether the planet formation processes that led to our solar system are universal.},

abstract = {Crystallization of a magma ocean on a large terrestrial planet that is significantly melted by the energy of accretion may lead to an unstable cumulate density stratification, which may overturn to a stable configuration. Overturn of the initially unstable stratification may produce an early basaltic crust and differentiated mantle reservoirs. Such a stable compositional stratification can have important implications for the planet's subsequent evolution by delaying or suppressing thermal convection and by influencing the distribution of radiogenic heat sources. We use simple models for fractional crystallization of a Martian magma ocean, and calculate the densities of the resulting cumulates. While the simple models presented do not include all relevant physical processes, they are able to describe to first order a number of aspects of Martian evolution. The models describe the creation of magma source regions that differentiated early in the history of Mars, and present the possibility of an early, brief magnetic field initiated by cold overturned cumulates falling to the core-mantle boundary. In a model that includes the density inversion at about 7.5 GPa, where olivine and pyroxene float in the remaining magma ocean liquids while garnet sinks, cumulate overturn sequesters alumina in the deep Martian interior. The ages and compositions of source regions are consistent with SNC meteorite data.},

We have extended analytically the approximate solution due to A. S. Kompaneets (1960,Sov. Phys. Dokl. Engl. Transl.5, 46–48) for the blast wave obtained for atmospheric nuclear explosions (idealized to isothermal atmospheres) to ideal adiabatic atmospheres and to data-based models of the Earth's atmosphere. For the first time, we have been able to obtainanalyticallythe particle trajectories in an isothermal atmosphere. The outcome of this nonlinear analysis is that a massive impact (without the subsequent ejection of substantial mass) would only influence a column of ≈30-km radius in the Earth's atmosphere and that the shocked gas would be propelled up and against the column “wall,” but would not escape from the planet. We examined the validity of “hemispheric blowoff,” the hypothesis that all material in a hemisphere lying above a plane tangent to the point of impact radially accelerated outward and, if sufficiently energetic, would also be ejected. We adapted and used a state-of-the-art code (CAVEAT), a hybrid Los Alamos–Sandia Lagrangian–Eulerian finite difference scheme for multimaterial flow problems with large distortion and internal slip. In our CAVEAT calculations, the vapor cloud produced by the impact produces a shock that is orders of magnitude stronger than any previous use of such codes. We developed new methods to test the accuracy and convergence of CAVEAT for K/T size impact events, and it proved to be a robust tool. We explored a K/T size impact where the 9-km-radius bolide was vaporized and injected into the atmosphere and found no radial outflow in agreement with the analytic model but, instead, a 50-km-radius vertical column formed with only a small fraction of material reaching escape velocity—no more than about 7{\%} of the vaporized bolide plus atmospheric mass will escape the gravitation of the Earth.},

Four major isotopic groups are recognized: (1) C1 and C2 carbonaceous chondrites have $\delta$15N of+30to+50{\%}.; (2) enstatite chondrites have $\delta$15N of−30to−40‰; (3) C3 chondrites have low $\delta$15N with large internal variations; (4) ordinary chondrites have $\delta$15N of−10to+20‰. The major variations are primary, representing isotopic abundances established at the time of condensation and accretion. Secondary processes, such as spallation reactions, solar wind implantation and metamorphic loss may cause small but observable isotopic variations in particular cases. The large isotopic difference between enstatite chondrites and carbonaceous chondrites cannot be accounted for by equilibrium condensation from a homogeneous nebular gas, and requires either unusually large kinetic effects, or a temporal or spatial variation of isotopic composition of the nebula. Nitrogen isotopic heterogeneity in the nebula due to nuclear processes has not been firmly established, but may be required to account for the large variations found within the Allende and Leoville meteorites. The unique carbonaceous chondrite, Renazzo, has $\delta$15N of+170{\%}., which is well beyond the range of all other data, and also requires a special source. It is not yet possible, from the meteoritic data, to establish the mode of accretion of nitrogen onto the primitive Earth.},

abstract = {Accretion models for the Earth and terrestrial planets are based on the distribution of siderophile (iron-loving) elements between metal and silicate. Extensive experimental studies of the partitioning of these elements between metallic liquid and silicate melt have led to a better understanding and a more sophisticated application to planetary problems. Siderophile element metal/silicate partition coefficients are a function of temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and metal and silicate composition. Quantification of these effects for a limited subset of siderophile elements has led to the idea that early Earth had a 700-km or deeper magma ocean. This new understanding of siderophile element partitioning has also led to applications to the kinetics of metal-silicate equilibrium, links to the timing of core formation, and a better understanding of core formation and metal-silicate equilibrium in the Moon and Mars. Key issues for future consideration include the role of water in early Earth, consideration of the core as a reservoir for noble gases and/or traditionally lithophile elements, siderophile element concentrations in the deep mantle, oxygen fugacity at high pressures, and further evaluation of the need for a late accretional veneer. The strongest approach to improving accretion models for the terrestrial planets is one that combines geochemistry, geophysics, and planetary dynamics.},

abstract = {The high-pressure solubility in silicate liquids of moderately siderophile 'iron-loving' elements (such as nickel and cobalt) has been used to suggest that, in the early Earth, an equilibrium between core-forming metals and the silicate mantle was established at the bottom of a magma ocean. But observed concentrations of the highly siderophile elements--such as the platinum-group elements platinum, palladium, rhenium, iridium, ruthenium and osmium--in the Earth's upper mantle can be explained by such a model only if their metal-silicate partition coefficients at high pressure are orders of magnitude lower than those determined experimentally at one atmosphere (refs 3-8). Here we present an experimental determination of the solubility of palladium and platinum in silicate melts as a function of pressure to 16 GPa (corresponding to about 500 km depth in the Earth). We find that both the palladium and platinum metal-silicate partition coefficients, derived from solubility, do not decrease with pressure--that is, palladium and platinum retain a strong preference for the metal phase even at high pressures. Consequently the observed abundances of palladium and platinum in the upper mantle seem to be best explained by a 'late veneer' addition of chondritic material to the upper mantle following the cessation of core formation.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the distribution, geochemical cycle, and evolution of CO2 and N2 in Earth's degassed mantle, and atmosphere plus continental crust. We estimate the present distribution of CO2 and N2 in Earth's degassed mantle based on amounts of He and Ar in the degassed mantle and observed outgassing ratios of CO2/He and N2{\textgreater}/Ar at mid-ocean ridges. Estimated CO2 in present degassed mantle is (1.8−6+9) × 1022 mol, representing (72 ± 10){\%} of total degassable CO2, an amount far higher than fractions previously inferred for noble gases. This strongly suggests that most CO2 has been recycled from Earth's surface into the degassed mantle through subduction, which is consistent with many recent discussions. For N2, the estimated amount in the present mantle is ∼ 2.5 × 1019 mol, representing ∼ 12{\%} of total degassable N2. Recycling of N2 back to the mantle is also inferred, but on a much smaller scale. A simple model for the outgassing and recycling of CO2 and N2 in Earth is presented. Outgassing is assumed to be via melt-vapor partitioning of volatiles. Recycling back into the mantle via subduction is assumed to be proportional to the mass of the volatile component in the crust. This simple model is consistent with all currently available constraints. Difficulties arise from the dependence of the recycling constant on time. Hence, no single evolution history can be obtained for CO2 based on the available data. Model results tentatively point to a higher CO2 content on Earth's surface in the Archean and Proterozoic than at present. Important future constraints may come from records in sedimentary rocks, improved understanding of carbonate production, and better modeling of the recycling process.},

abstract = {High-pressure experiments (5–10 GPa, corresponding to approximately 150–300 km depth in the mantle) have been conducted on a basalt+calcite mixture in order to constrain the fate of carbonates carried on subducted ocean floor. At 5 GPa, carbonate breakdown occurs between 1100 and 1150°C, and coincides with silicate melting. At 6.5 GPa and above, only carbonatitic melts were produced and the solidus temperature is located below 1000°C. Liquid immiscibility is observed at the transition from silicate to carbonate melting (6 GPa and 1300°C). The carbonatitic solidus in the eclogite is located 4 GPa higher in pressure than in the peridotitic system. This is due to the difference of silicate mineralogies involved in carbonation reactions. In addition, carbonatites produced in the present study are calcium-rich (Ca/(Ca+Fe+Mg) ca. 0.80), in striking contrast to those produced by melting of carbonated peridotite (Ca/(Ca+Fe+Mg) ca. 0.50). Carbonated eclogite should therefore be considered as a potential source for the most abundant carbonatite type worldwide, but it is stressed that carbonatitic magmatism could be a multistage process. Compared to pressure–temperature paths of subducting slabs, the present results suggest that carbonates will most likely be removed from the slab before reaching 300 km, and are unlikely to be introduced by subduction either in the transition zone or in the lower mantle. Therefore, the deep carbon cycle appears to be restricted to the upper mantle (300 km or shallower depths). Carbonate-enriched portions located in cooler parts of the slab (fractures) could allow for oxidized carbon introduction to deeper mantle regions, but more experiments at higher pressures are necessary to evaluate this hypothesis. Because carbonatite production from carbonated eclogites occurs in the diamond stability field, the present experimental results lend further support to recent models of diamond formation involving carbonated melts in the mantle.},

abstract = {Measurements are reported for the pressure dependence of the Ostwald L and mole‐fraction x 2solubilities for nitrogen, argon, krypton, and xenon in water at 25.0 °C. The approximate pressure ranges were: N2, 44–116 atm; Ar, 22–101 atm; Kr, 33–81 atm; and Xe, 5–48 atm. Our experimental technique is a modified Van Slyke method which allows the simultaneous determination of L, x 2, and partial molar volume v 2 of the solute gas in the solvent. For N2, Ar, and Kr we observe deviations from Henry's Law, f 2=k H x 2 which vary linearly with pressure. For example, the measured values of Henry's constant range from k H (25 °C, 44.6 atm)=90 269 atm to k H (25 °C, 115.8 atm)=100 340 atm for N2 in water. Extrapolation of the data to low pressure yields results for L and x 2 which agree with literature values. For Xe we observe a sharp increase in Henry's constant at pressures above 20 atm. The measured partial molar volume also changes sharply from 47 to ∼125 cm3/mol. This is attributed to the observed onset of ice‐like clathrates at pressures above 20 atm. The solubility data are analyzed in terms of the Kirkwood–Buff solution theory, and the role of hydrophobic interactions is discussed. For the Kr–water system, we compare the experimental results to recent computer simulations. We also use statistical mechanics arguments to introduce a new solubility parameter which is useful in understanding high‐pressure measurements. We conclude by discussing extensions of this work to other gas–liquid systems.},

abstract = {The compact multi-transiting planet systems discovered by Kepler challenge planet formation theories. Formation in situ from disks with radial mass surface density, $\Sigma$, profiles similar to the minimum mass solar nebula but boosted in normalization by factors 10 has been suggested. We propose that a more natural way to create these planets in the inner disk is formation sequentially from the inside-out via creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous stream of small ({\~{}}cm-m size) pebbles, drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles collect at the pressure maximum associated with the transition from a magnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive (dead zone) region to an inner MRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up until it either becomes gravitationally unstable to form an {\~{}}1 M ⊕ planet directly or induces gradual planet formation via core accretion. The planet may undergo Type I migration into the active region, allowing a new pebble ring and planet to form behind it. Alternatively, if migration is inefficient, the planet may continue to accrete from the disk until it becomes massive enough to isolate itself from the accretion flow. A variety of densities may result depending on the relative importance of residual gas accretion as the planet approaches its isolation mass. The process can repeat with a new pebble ring gathering at the new pressure maximum associated with the retreating dead-zone boundary. Our simple analytical model for this scenario of inside-out planet formation yields planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbital radius, and minimum orbital separations consistent with those seen by Kepler. It provides an explanation of how massive planets can form with tightly packed and well-aligned system architectures, starting from typical protoplanetary disk properties.},

We discuss radial mixing and water delivery, planetary spins and the importance of parameters regarding the disk and embryo properties. Next, we connect accretion models to exoplanets. We first explain why the observed hot Super Earths probably formed by in situ accretion or inward migration. We show how terrestrial planet formation is altered in systems with gas giants by the mechanisms of giant planet migration and dynamical instabilities. Standard models of terrestrial accretion fail to reproduce the inner Solar System. The "Grand Tack" model solves this problem using ideas first developed to explain the giant exoplanets.

abstract = {The present study aims to constrain the composition of the initial lunar magma ocean (LMO) with fluid dynamic and thermodynamic consideration. A plausible range of the initial LMO composition is investigated by developing an incremental polybaric fractional crystallization model with variable fractionation efficiency to satisfy three conditions for the anorthosite crust formation: (1) the amount of anorthite crystallized from the LMO is abundant enough to form the crust with the observed thickness, (2) the Mg{\#} (=Mg/(Mg+Fe)) of orthopyroxene crystallized with anorthite in the cooling LMO is consistent with that observed in the lunar highland rocks, ferroan anorthosite, and (3) crystallized anorthite separated to float in the turbulent LMO. A plausible range of FeO and Al2O3 contents of the bulk LMO is successfully constrained as a crescent region tight for FeO and loose for Al2O3. The FeO content must be higher than 1.3 times the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) and lower than 1.8×BSE unless the Al2O3 content of the Moon is extremely higher than the Earth. These upper and lower limits for FeO are positively correlated with the initial Al2O3 content and fractionation efficiency. The FeO–rich LMO composition may suggest that the circum-Earth disk just after the giant impact of the Earth–Moon system formation was more oxidizing or the impactor was richer in FeO than the Earth's mantle.},

abstract = {Dauphas et al. [Astrophys. J. 565 (2002) 640–644] reported molybdenum isotopic anomalies in differentiated and bulk primitive meteorites. It is shown here that these isotopic anomalies correlate with one another in exactly the way expected from nucleosynthesis theory if different regions of the nebula received different contributions of s-process matter synthesized in low-mass AGB stars. Furthermore, when bulk measurements are grouped by meteorite class, the molybdenum isotopic anomalies correlate with the ruthenium isotopic anomalies recently reported by Chen et al. [Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXIV (2003) {\#}1789], again indicating a heterogeneous distribution of s-process matter. As molybdenum is only moderately siderophile, most of the molybdenum presently in the mantle was delivered before the completion of core formation. In contrast, because ruthenium is highly siderophile, nearly all of the mantle ruthenium was delivered by a late veneer, after the end of core formation. Thus, the fact the silicate Earth lies on the Mo–Ru cosmic correlation supports the idea that the Earth accreted homogeneously. Stated otherwise, the feeding zone of the Earth did not change drastically with time, as both the bulk of the Earth and the late veneer accreted from material from the same Mo–Ru isotopic reservoir.},

abstract = {Consequences of a heavy bombardment for the atmospheres of Earth and Mars are investigated with a stochastic model. The main result is the dominance of the accumulation. The atmospheric pressure is strongly increasing both for Earth and Mars in the course of an enhanced bombardment. The effect of atmospheric erosion is found to be minor, regarding escape during meteorite entry, in the expanding vapor plume, and ejection due to free-surface motion. The initial atmospheric surface pressure if comparable to the modern value turns out as a less important additive constant of the final pressure. Impactor retention and atmospheric erosion are parametrized in terms of scaling laws, compatible with recent numerical simulations. The dependence on impactor size, atmospheric and planetary parameters is analyzed among alternative models and numerical results. The stochastic model is fed with the net replenishment originating from impactor material and the loss of preexisting atmospheric gas. Major input parameters are the total cumulative impactor mass and the relative mass of atmophile molecules in comets and asteroids. Input size distributions of the impactor ensemble correspond to presently observed main belt asteroids and KBOs. Velocity distributions are taken from dynamical simulations for the Nice model. Depending on the composition of large cometary impactors, the Earth could acquire a more massive atmosphere, a few bars in terms of surface pressure, mostly as CO and CO2. For Mars accumulation of 1–4 bars of CO and CO2 requires an asteroidal ‘late veneer' of the order of 1024g containing 2{\%} atmophiles.},

abstract = {Water photolysis and hydrogen loss from the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets is of fundamental importance to climate evolution but remains poorly understood in general. Here we present a range of calculations we performed to study the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of atmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO2 can only cause significant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range of conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a bottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss only occurs on planets with intermediate CO2 atmospheric partial pressures (0.1-1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse limit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but X-ray and ultraviolet/ultravoilet luminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like Earth. In contrast, for a CO2-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss are only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios where the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around M-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets that absorb less flux than {\~{}}270 W m–2 (global mean) unlikely to lose more than one Earth ocean of H2O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their atmospheric N2/CO2 early on. Because of the variability of H2O delivery during accretion, our results suggest that many Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone may have ocean-covered surfaces, stable CO2/H2O-rich atmospheres, and high mean surface temperatures.},

abstract = {The structure of Earthʼs deep inner core has important implications for core evolution, since it is thought to be related to the early stages of core formation. Previous studies have suggested that there exists an innermost inner core with distinct anisotropy relative to the rest of the inner core. Using an extensive new data set of handpicked absolute travel time observations of the inner core phase PKIKP, we find that the data are best explained by variations in anisotropy between two hemispheres and do not require an innermost inner core. We demonstrate that observations of an innermost inner core are an artifact from averaging over lateral anisotropy variations. More significantly we show that hemispherical variations in anisotropy, previously only imaged in the upper inner core, continue to its centre. The eastern region has 0.5–1.5{\%} anisotropy, whereas the western region has 3.5–8.8{\%} anisotropy increasing with depth, with a slow direction at 57–61° to the Earthʼs rotation axis at all depths. Such anisotropy is consistent with models of aligned hcp or bcc iron aggregates.},

abstract = {During silicate melting on Earth, W is one of the most incompatible trace elements, similar to Th, Ba or U. As W is also moderately siderophile during metal segregation, ratios of W and the lithophile Th and U in silicate rocks have therefore been used to constrain the W abundance of the Earth's mantle and the Hf–W age of core formation. This study presents high-precision W concentration data obtained by isotope dilution for samples covering important silicate reservoirs on Earth. The data reveal significant fractionations of W from other highly incompatible lithophile elements such as Th, U, and Ta. Many arc lavas exhibit a selective enrichment of W relative to Th, U, and Nb–Ta, reflecting W enrichment in the sub-arc mantle via fluid-like components derived from subducting plates. In contrast, during enrichment by melt-like subduction components, W is generally slightly depleted relative to Th and U, but is still enriched relative to Ta. Hence, all arc rocks and the continental crust exhibit uniformly low Ta/W (ca. 1), whereas W/Th and W/U may show opposite fractionation trends, depending on the role of fluid- and melt-like subduction components. Further high-precision W data for OIBs and MORBs reveal a systematic depletion of W in both rock types relative to other HFSE, resulting in high Ta/W that are complementary to the low Ta/W observed in arc rocks and the continental crust. Similar to previous interpretations based on Nb/U and Ce/Pb systematics, our Ta/W data confirm a depletion of the depleted upper mantle (DM) in fluid mobile elements relative to the primitive mantle (PRIMA). The abundance of W in the depleted upper mantle relative to other immobile and highly incompatible elements such as Nb and Ta is therefore not representative of the bulk silicate Earth. Based on mass balance calculations using Ta–W systematics in the major silicate reservoirs, the W abundance of the Earth's primitive mantle can be constrained to 12ppb, resulting in revised ratios of W–U and W–Th of 0.53 and 0.14, respectively. The newly constrained Hf–W ratio of the silicate Earth is 25.8, significantly higher than previously estimated (18.7) and overlaps within error the Hf–W ratio proposed for the Moon (ca. 24.9). The 182Hf–182W model age for the formation of the Earth's core that is inferred from the 182W abundance and the Hf/W of the silicate Earth is therefore younger than previously calculated, by up to 5Myrs after solar system formation depending on the accretion models used. The similar Hf/W ratios and 182W compositions of the Earth and the silicate Moon suggest a strong link between the Moon forming giant impact and final metal–silicate equilibration on the Earth.},

abstract = {The Earth formed through the accretion of numerous planetary embryos that were already differentiated into a metallic core and silicate mantle. Prevailing models of Earth's formation, constrained by the observed abundances of metal-loving siderophile elements in Earth's mantle, assume full metal–silicate equilibrium, whereby all memory of the planetary embryos' earlier differentiation is lost1, 2. Using the hafnium–tungsten (Hf–W) and uranium–lead (U–Pb) isotopic dating systems, these models suggest rapid accretion of Earth's main mass within about 10 million years3, 4, 5, 6 (Myr) of the formation of the Solar System. Accretion terminated about 303, 7 or 1004, 5 Myr after formation of the Solar System, owing to a giant impact that formed the Moon. Here we present geochemical models of Earth's accretion that preserve some memory of the embryos' original differentiation. These disequilibrium models allow some fraction of the embryos' metallic cores to directly enter the Earth's core, without equilibrating with Earth's mantle. We show that disequilibrium models are as compatible with the geochemical observations as equilibrium models, yet still provide bounds on Earth's accretion and core formation. We find that the Hf–W data mainly constrain the degree of equilibration rather than the timing, whereas the U–Pb data confirm that the end of accretion is consistent with recent estimates of the age of the Moon8, 9. Our results indicate that only 36{\%} of the Earth's core must have formed in equilibrium with Earth's mantle. This low degree of equilibration is consistent with the siderophile element abundances in Earth's mantle.},

abstract = {The chalcophile and highly siderophile elements Se and Te, like the other Highly Siderophile Elements (HSE) in the terrestrial mantle, may constitute powerful key tracers for meteoritic materials that hit the Earth in its latest accretionary stages (“Late Veneer”). Here the Se and Te systematics of mantle-derived peridotites (orogenic peridotites, ophiolites, cratonic peridotite xenoliths) are assessed. Combined with published in-situ analyses of HSE host minerals, whole-rock data are modelled with respect to current petrogenetic models that affect mantle composition, for example partial melting and magmatic refertilisation. We demonstrate that the near-chondritic Se/Te signature (SeN/TeN≈9±4; N = CI-chondrite normalised) of “fertile” ophiolitic and orogenic lherzolites cannot be a primitive signature of the Earthʼs mantle. This signature can however be explained by simple refertilisation models. The HSE–Se–Te budget of these fertile rocks can be modelled by mixing various proportions of a residual assemblage of Fe–Ni monosulphide solid solutions (Mss) and/or refractory platinum group minerals (PGMs – Ru–Os–Ir sulphides + Pt–Ir–Os alloys) with a metasomatic assemblage comprising low-temperature Pt–Pd–Te phases and Cu–Ni-rich sulphides. On the other hand, the reported Se and Te ratios in fertile peridotites are not consistent with melt depletion alone. Additions of late-stage metasomatic S–Se–Te–HSE-rich phases render Primitive Upper Mantle (PUM) estimates for Se and Te highly debatable, especially without appropriate consideration of refertilisation and metasomatism. Our results indicate that there is currently no firm evidence for chondritic S–Se–Te signatures in the Primitive Upper Mantle. This conclusion challenges the simplistic perception that near-chondritic Se/Te ratios may readily trace the Late Veneer composition.},

abstract = {Using a new photochemical model of the Earthʼs early atmosphere, the relationship between noble gas photoionization and organic photochemistry has been investigated from the Archean eon to the present day. We have found that the enhanced UV emission of the young Sun triggered a peculiar atmospheric chemistry in a CH4-rich early atmosphere that resulted in the increased formation of an organic haze, similar to the preliminary results of a previous study (Ribas et al., 2010). We have investigated the interaction between this haze and noble gases photoionized by the UV light from the younger Sun. Laboratory experiments have shown indeed that ionized xenon trapping into organics (1) is more efficient that other ionized noble gases trapping and (2) results in a significant enrichment of heavy xenon isotopes relative to the light ones (e.g., Frick et al., 1979; Marrocchi et al., 2011). We find moreover preferential photoionization of xenon that peaks at an altitude range comparable to that of the organic haze formation, in contrast to other noble gases. Trapping and fractioning of ionized xenon in the organic haze could therefore have been far more efficient than for other noble gases, and could have been particularly effective throughout the Archean eon, since the UV irradiation flux from the young Sun was expected to be substantially higher than today (Ribas et al., 2010; Claire et al., 2012). Thus we suspect that the unique isotopic fractionation of atmospheric xenon and its elemental depletion in the atmosphere relative to other noble gases, compared to potential cosmochemical components, could have resulted from a preferential incorporation of the heaviest xenon isotopes into organics. A fraction of atmospheric xenon could have been continuously trapped in the forming haze and enriched in its heavy isotopes, while another fraction would have escaped from the atmosphere to space, with, or without isotope selection of the lightest isotopes. The combination of these two processes over long periods of time provides thereby a key process for explaining the evolution of its isotopic composition in the atmosphere over time that has been observed in Archean archives (Pujol et al., 2011).},

abstract = {In order to assess the proportion of solar, cosmogenic, and indigenous water (hydrogen) trapped in individual Ti-rich lunar volcanic glasses (LVGs) from the 74002 core obtained during the Apollo 17 mission, we coupled ion microprobe measurements of water abundances and D/H ratios with CO2 laser extraction-static mass spectrometry analyses of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar). The large (∼300-400 $\mu$m in diameter) LVGs studied here contain a small amount of solar wind (SW) volatiles implanted at the grain surfaces, as indicated by the small concentrations of solar helium and neon that represent ⩽5{\%} of the respective total noble gas abundances. The large proportion of volume-correlated cosmogenic gases reflects an exposure duration of ∼28 Ma, on average, of the glasses at the lunar surface. Hydrogen abundances determined in the grain interiors of glassy and partially-crystalline LVGs are equivalent to between 6.5 and 54.3 ppm H2O. Based on the noble gas exposure ages, the correction of the measured hydrogen isotope composition for in-situ production of cosmogenic deuterium by spallation reactions varies between -5 to -254 ‰ for the different grains. Corrected $\delta$D values range from +38 ‰ to +809 ‰ in the LVGs and are anti-correlated with the water content, consistent with extensive hydrogen isotope fractionation during kinetic H2 loss from a lunar melt with an inferred initial isotope signature of the order of -100 ‰ and a water content of 100-300 ppm. The detection of water in these primitive lunar melts confirms the presence of a non-anhydrous mantle reservoir within the Moon. Furthermore, our results reveal that the hydrogen isotope composition of water in the melt source of the 74002 LVGs is similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites. These observations indicate that the contribution of deuterium-enriched cometary water to the Earth-Moon system is negligible.},

abstract = {The existence of water in extrasolar planetary systems is of great interest because it constrains the potential for habitable planets and life. We have identified a circumstellar disk that resulted from the destruction of a water-rich and rocky extrasolar minor planet. The parent body formed and evolved around a star somewhat more massive than the Sun, and the debris now closely orbits the white dwarf remnant of the star. The stellar atmosphere is polluted with metals accreted from the disk, including oxygen in excess of that expected for oxide minerals, indicating that the parent body was originally composed of 26{\%} water by mass. This finding demonstrates that water-bearing planetesimals exist around A- and F-type stars that end their lives as white dwarfs.},

@article{Wordsworth2013a,
abstract = {Water photolysis and hydrogen loss from the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets is of fundamental importance to climate evolution but remains poorly understood in general. Here we present a range of calculations we performed to study the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of atmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO2 can only cause significant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range of conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a bottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss only occurs on planets with intermediate CO2 atmospheric partial pressures (0.1 to 1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse limit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but XUV/UV luminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like Earth. In contrast, for a CO2-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss are only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios where the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around M-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets that absorb less flux than {\~{}}270 W/m{\^{}}2 (global mean) unlikely to lose more than one Earth ocean of H2O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their atmospheric N2/CO2 early on. Because of the variability of H2O delivery during accretion, our results suggest that many 'Earth-like' exoplanets in the habitable zone may have ocean-covered surfaces, stable CO2/H2O-rich atmospheres, and high mean surface temperatures.},

@article{Wagner2002,
abstract = {In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) adopted a new formulation called “The IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use”, which we abbreviate to IAPWS-95 formulation or IAPWS-95 for short. This IAPWS-95 formulation replaces the previous formulation adopted in 1984. This work provides information on the selected experimental data of the thermodynamic properties of water used to develop the new formulation, but information is also given on newer data. The article presents all details of the IAPWS-95 formulation, which is in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. The function for the residual part of the Helmholtz free energy was fitted to selected data for the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single-phase region (p$\rho$T) and of the vapor–liquid phase boundary (p$\sigma$$\rho$′$\rho$″T), including the phase-equilibrium condition (Maxwell criterion), and (b) the caloric properties specific isochoric heat capacity, specific isobaric heat capacity, speed of sound, differences in the specific enthalpy and in the specific internal energy, Joule–Thomson coefficient, and isothermal throttling coefficient. By applying modern strategies for optimizing the functional form of the equation of state and for the simultaneous nonlinear fitting to the data of all mentioned properties, the resulting IAPWS-95 formulation covers a validity range for temperatures from the melting line (lowest temperature 251.2 K at 209.9 MPa) to 1273 K and pressures up to 1000 MPa. In this entire range of validity, IAPWS-95 represents even the most accurate data to within their experimental uncertainty. In the most important part of the liquid region, the estimated uncertainty of IAPWS-95 ranges from ±0.001{\%} to ±0.02{\%} in density, ±0.03{\%} to ±0.2{\%} in speed of sound, and ±0.1{\%} in isobaric heat capacity. In the liquid region at ambient pressure, IAPWS-95 is extremely accurate in density (uncertainty ⩽±0.0001{\%}) and in speed of sound (±0.005{\%}). In a large part of the gas region the estimated uncertainty in density ranges from ±0.03{\%} to ±0.05{\%}, in speed of sound it amounts to ±0.15{\%} and in isobaric heat capacity it is ±0.2{\%}. In the critical region, IAPWS-95 represents not only the thermal properties very well but also the caloric properties in a reasonable way. Special interest has been focused on the extrapolation behavior of the new formulation. At least for the basic properties such as pressure and enthalpy, IAPWS-95 can be extrapolated up to extremely high pressures and temperatures. In addition to the IAPWS-95 formulation, independent equations for vapor pressure, the densities, and the most important caloric properties along the vapor–liquid phase boundary, and for the pressure on the melting and sublimation curve, are given. Moreover, a so-called gas equation for densities up to 55 kg m−3 is also included. Tables of the thermodynamic properties calculated from the IAPWS-95 formulation are listed in the Appendix. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {In view of the important role that water substance plays in science and industry, this paper lists the thermophysical properties of fluid H2O which are most needed for engineering applications. The properties are described in a very compact form with the aid of explicit expressions for programing on a computer and for inclusion in data banks. The paper includes a fundamental equation in the form of the Helmholtz free energy expressed as an analytic function of temperature and density. This fundamental equation is a dimensionless version of the Provisional IAPS Formulation 1982 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for Scientific and General Use, which enables one to calculate all equilibrium thermodynamic properties in a wide range of states, but with the exclusion of a small region near the critical point. In the latter region, the equilibrium properties are described by a scaled fundamental equation in the form of the pressure as a function of chemical potential and temperature. In addition, the paper gives equations for the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension. All equations in the paper are mutually thermodynamically consistent. The set of equations and their constants listed here represents the most reliable information according to the judgment of the authors.},

abstract = {The excess of highly siderophile (iron-loving) elements (HSEs) and the chondritic ratios of most HSEs in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) may reflect the accretion of a chondritic 'late veneer' of about 0.5 per cent of Earth's mass after core formation. The amount of volatiles contained in the late veneer is a key constraint on the budget and the origin of the volatiles in Earth. At high pressures and temperatures, the moderately volatile chalcogen elements sulphur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) are moderately to highly siderophile; thus, if depleted by core formation their mantle abundances should reflect the volatile composition of the late veneer. Here we report ratios and abundances of S, Se and Te in the mantle determined from new isotope dilution data for post-Archaean mantle peridotites. The mean S/Se and Se/Te ratios of mantle lherzolites overlap with CI (Ivuna-type) carbonaceous chondrite values. The Se/Te ratios of ordinary and enstatite chondrites are significantly different. The chalcogen/HSE ratio of the BSE is similar to that of CM (Mighei-type) carbonaceous chondrites, consistent with the view that the HSE signature of the BSE reflects a predominance of slightly volatile-depleted, carbonaceous-chondrite-like material, possibly with a minor proportion of non-chondritic material. Depending on the estimates for the abundances of water and carbon in the BSE, the late veneer may have supplied 20 to 100 per cent of the budget of hydrogen and carbon in the BSE.},

Thermal and chemical evolution of magma ocean is investigated based on a one-dimensional two-phase-flow heat and mass transfer model. Differentiation at lower mantle pressure depends on the type of magma ocean and surrounding atmosphere. If the magma ocean is formed by the blanketing effect of a solar-type proto-atmosphere, extensive differentiation proceeds at lower mantle pressure. If the magma ocean is formed by the blanketing effect of an impact-induced steam atmosphere, no differentiation at lower mantle pressure is likely. If a very deep magma ocean is formed by a giant impact, whether differentiation proceeds at lower mantle pressure or not depends on grain size, viscosity of melt and/or properties of a transient atmosphere. On the contrary, chemical differentiation likely proceeds at upper mantle pressure irrespective of magma ocean type. A shallow magma ocean can remain for 100 ∼ 200 My without any heating processes.},

abstract = {We measured the electrical resistivity of iron and iron-silicon alloy to 100 GPa. The resistivity of iron was also calculated to core pressures. Combined with the first geophysical model accounting for saturation resistivity of core metal, the present results show that the thermal conductivity of the outermost core is greater than 90 W/m/K. These values are significantly higher than conventional estimates, implying rapid secular core cooling, an inner core younger than 1 Ga, and ubiquitous melting of the lowermost mantle during the early Earth. An enhanced conductivity with depth suppresses convection in the deep core, such that its center may have been stably stratified prior to the onset of inner core crystallization. A present heat flow in excess of 10 TW is likely required to explain the observed dynamo characteristics.},

abstract = {The newly formed giant planets may have migrated and crossed a number of mutual mean motion resonances (MMRs) when smaller objects (embryos) were accreting to form the terrestrial planets in the planetesimal disk. We investigated the effects of the planetesimal-driven migration of Jupiter and Saturn, and the influence of their mutual 1:2 MMR crossing on terrestrial planet formation for the first time, by performing N-body simulations. These simulations considered distinct timescales of MMR crossing and planet migration. In total, 68 high-resolution simulation runs using 2000 disk planetesimals were performed, which was a significant improvement on previously published results. Even when the effects of the 1:2 MMR crossing and planet migration were included in the system, Venus and Earth analogs (considering both orbits and masses) successfully formed in several runs. In addition, we found that the orbits of planetesimals beyond a {\~{}} 1.5-2 AU were dynamically depleted by the strengthened sweeping secular resonances associated with Jupiter's and Saturn's more eccentric orbits (relative to the present day) during planet migration. However, this depletion did not prevent the formation of massive Mars analogs (planets with more than 1.5 times Mars's mass). Although late MMR crossings (at t {\textgreater} 30 Myr) could remove such planets, Mars-like small mass planets survived on overly excited orbits (high e and/or i), or were completely lost in these systems. We conclude that the orbital migration and crossing of the mutual 1:2 MMR of Jupiter and Saturn are unlikely to provide suitable orbital conditions for the formation of solar system terrestrial planets. This suggests that to explain Mars's small mass and the absence of other planets between Mars and Jupiter, the outer asteroid belt must have suffered a severe depletion due to interactions with Jupiter/Saturn, or by an alternative mechanism (e.g., rogue super-Earths).},

abstract = {The Earth's outer core appears to be compositionally layered. Exotic mechanisms such as an original chemically layered core preserved from the Earth's accretionary period, or compositionally different core material delivered by a Moon-creating impactor are conceivable, but require a core whose outermost part has been stratified throughout core history, relying on unknowable processes to achieve. Barodiffusion and core-mantle reaction lead to layers significantly thinner than observed. We show that a balance of mass transferred from the inner core to the top of the outer core is possible, and that the stratification could arise as a byproduct of light element accumulation. However, if a subadiabatic thermal gradient at the top of the outer core exists that quells radial flow, it could serve as a witness of light element accumulation by preventing mixing with the convecting part of the core. The temperature difference through a subadiabatic layer could be 100-300 K and carry heat fluxes through the core-mantle boundary of 0.5-25 TW, given uncertainty in core properties.},

Models have been created that can produce a disk of debris with the proper mass and composition to create our Moon. Models have also been created which start with a disk of debris that eventually coalesces into a Moon. To date, no model has been created that produces a stable Earth-Moon system in a single simulation. Here we combine two recently published ideas in this field, along with a new gravity-centered model, and generate such a simulation. In addition, we show how the method can produce a heterogeneous, iron-deficient Moon made of mantle material from both colliding bodies, and a resultant Earth whose equatorial plane is significantly tilted off the ecliptic plane. The accuracy of the simulation adds credence to the theory that our Moon was born from the violent union of two heavenly bodies.},

abstract = {A shock Hugoniot compression curve for water has been measured up to less than 1 GPa. A plane and steady shock wave is produced in water by the flat plate impact of a projectile accelerated by a compressed gas gun. A new experimental procedure was proposed to detect the shock wave front sensitively, which makes it possible to measure shock Hugoniot in higher precision than the previous method. The present method is based on the very large pressure dependence of the refractive index of water upon compression. By using this method, the shock compression curve was determined within the precision of 2{\%} to 3{\%} of the estimated shock pressure. The precision is better than that of the previous data. It was confirmed that within the pressure range covered in this experiment, the shock-particle velocity Hugoniot can be described by a linear relation with a large slope. Shock Hugoniot states on the pressure–temperature plane were calculated by using the obtained Hugoniot data combined with the values of thermodynamical variables. Thermodynamic analysis of the shock compression process was developed to estimate the contributions of irreversible heating by shock compression. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {The dynamics of a planet and its evolution are controlled to a large extent by its viscosity. In this study, we demonstrate that the dependence of mantle viscosity on temperature and water concentration introduces strong dynamic feedbacks. We derive a dimensionless parameter to quantitatively evaluate the relative strength of those feedbacks, and show that water and heat transport are equally important in controlling present-day dynamics for the Earth. A simple parameterized evolution model illustrates the strong feedbacks and behavior of the system and agrees well with our analytic results. The analysis identifies characteristic times for changes of viscosity, temperature, and water concentration and demonstrates, for time scales greater than a few hundred million years, that the system should either be degassing while warming or regassing while cooling. This yields a characteristic evolution in which, after an initial period of rapid adjustment, the mantle warms while degassing, and subsequently cools rapidly while regassing. As the planet continues to cool, the entire surface ocean may eventually return to the mantle. Our results suggest that a simple relationship may exist between the rate of change of water concentration and the rate of change of temperature in the mantle. This connection is extended by deriving an explicit equation for the Urey ratio that depends on both heat and water transport.},

We show that there are virtually no collisions with impact speeds lower than the surface escape velocity and a similar velocity-impact angle distribution for different planetesimal masses if velocities are normalized using the escape velocity. An additional perturbing Jupiter-like object distorts the collision velocity and impact picture in the sense that grazing impacts at higher velocities are promoted if the perturber's orbit is close to the habitable zone whereas a more distant perturber has more the effect of a mere widening of the velocity dispersion.},

We investigate the evolution of an impact-generated H2O–CO2 atmosphere at the final stage of accretion by using a one-dimensional radiative-convective atmosphere model. Since atmospheric pressure is high (∼200 bar) and close to the critical point of water vapor (647 K, 220 bar), we need to take into account the nonideal behavior of gases in the calculation. It is shown that the surface temperature suddenly decreases when the impact (accretion) energy flux decreases to about 150 W m−2, and that a proto-ocean is formed on the growing Earth. The estimated temperature of a proto-ocean is consistent with that of an archaean ocean estimated from the oxygen isotope data.},

abstract = {The water content and habitability of terrestrial planets are determined during their final assembly, from perhaps 100 1,000-km "planetary embryos " and a swarm of billions of 1-10-km "planetesimals. " During this process, we assume that water-rich material is accreted by terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies that originate in the outer asteroid region. We present analysis of water delivery and planetary habitability in five high-resolution simulations containing about 10 times more particles than in previous simulations. These simulations formed 15 terrestrial planets from 0.4 to 2.6 Earth masses, including five planets in the habitable zone. Every planet from each simulation accreted at least the Earth's current water budget; most accreted several times that amount (assuming no impact depletion). Each planet accreted at least five water-rich embryos and planetesimals from the past 2.5 astronomical units; most accreted 10-20 water-rich bodies. We present a new model for water delivery to terrestrial planets in dynamically calm systems, with low-eccentricity or low-mass giant planets-such systems may be very common in the Galaxy. We suggest that water is accreted in comparable amounts from a few planetary embryos in a " hit or miss " way and from millions of planetesimals in a statistically robust process. Variations in water content are likely to be caused by fluctuations in the number of water-rich embryos accreted, as well as from systematic effects, such as planetary mass and location, and giant planet properties.},

abstract = {In the current view of planet formation, the final assembly of the Earth involved giant collisions between proto-planets ({\textgreater} 1000 km radius), with the Moon formed as a result of one such impact. At this stage the colliding bodies had likely differentiated into a metallic core surrounded by a silicate mantle. During the Moon-forming impact, nearly all metal sank into the Earth's core. We investigate to what extent large self-gravitating iron cores can mix with surrounding silicate and how this influences the short-lived chronometer, Hf–W, used to infer the age of the Moon. We present fluid dynamical models of turbulent mixing in fully liquid systems, attempting to place constraints on the degree of mixing. Erosion of sinking cores driven by Rayleigh–Taylor instability does lead to intimate mixing and equilibration, but large blobs ({\textgreater} 10 km diameter) do not emulsify entirely. Emulsification is enhanced if most of the accreting metal cores deform into thin structures during descent through the Earth's mantle. Yet, only 1–20{\%} of Earth's core would equilibrate with silicate during Earth's accretion. The initial speed of the impactor is of little importance. We proceed to evaluate the mixing potential for shear instabilities where silicate entrainment across vertical walls causes mixing. The turbulent structure indicates that vortices remain at the largest scale and do not mix to centimeter length scale, where diffusion operates and isotopes can equilibrate. Thus, incomplete emulsification and equilibration of accreting iron cores is likely to occur. The extent of metal–silicate equilibration provides key information for interpretation of siderophile budgets and the timing of core formation using the Hf–W chronometer. The time scale of core formation derived from the Hf–W chronometer is usually tied to the last major metal–silicate re-equilibration, believed to coincide with time of the Moon-forming impact. However, we show that large cores have limited ability to reset the Hf–W system in the silicate Earth. Excess 182W in bulk silicate Earth is more sensitive to early core formation processes than to radiogenic ingrowth after the last giant impact.},

abstract = {Evidence in the Solar System suggests that the giant planets underwent an epoch of radial migration that was very rapid, with an e-folding timescale shorter than 1{\~{}}Myr. It is probable that the cause of this migration was that the giant planets experienced an orbital instability that caused them to encounter each other, resulting in radial migration. Several works suggest that this dynamical instability occurred `late', long after all the planets had formed and the solar nebula had dissipated. Assuming that the terrestrial planets had already formed, then their orbits would have been affected by the migration of the giant planets. As a result, how did the orbits of the terrestrial planets change? And can we use this migration to obtain information on the primordial orbits of the terrestrial planets? We directly model a large number of terrestrial planet systems and their response to giant planet migration. We study the change in the Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD) of the terrstrials. We conclude that the primordial AMD should have been lower than {\~{}}70$\backslash${\%} of the current value, but higher than 10$\backslash${\%}. We find that a scenario with five giant planets better satisfies the orbital constraints of the terrestrial planets. We predict that Mars was initially on an eccentric and inclined orbit while the orbits of Mercury, Venus and Earth were more circular and coplanar. The lower primordial dynamical excitement and the peculiar partitioning between planets impose new constraints for terrestrial planet formation simulations.},

abstract = {Despite its importance to questions of lunar origin, the chemical composition of the Moon is not precisely known. In recent years, however, the isotopic composition of lunar samples has been determined to high precision and found to be indistinguishable from the terrestrial mantle despite widespread isotopic heterogeneity in the Solar System. In the context of the giant-impact hypothesis, this level of isotopic homogeneity can evolve if the proto-lunar disk and post-impact Earth undergo turbulent mixing into a single uniform reservoir while the system is extensively molten and partially vaporized. In the absence of liquid–vapor separation, such a model leads to the lunar inheritance of the chemical composition of the terrestrial magma ocean. Hence, the turbulent mixing model raises the question of how chemical differences arose between the silicate Earth and Moon. Here we explore the consequences of liquid–vapor separation in one of the settings relevant to the lunar composition: the silicate vapor atmosphere of the post-giant-impact Earth. We use a model atmosphere to quantify the extent to which rainout can generate chemical differences by enriching the upper atmosphere in the vapor, and show that plausible parameters can generate the postulated enhancement in the FeO/MgO ratio of the silicate Moon relative to the Earth's mantle. Moreover, we show that liquid–vapor separation also generates measurable mass-dependent isotopic offsets between the silicate Earth and Moon and that precise silicon isotope measurements can be used to constrain the degree of chemical fractionation during this earliest period of lunar history. An approach of this kind has the potential to resolve long-standing questions on the lunar chemical composition.},

Here we explore the possibility that the silicate Earth and impactor were compositionally distinct with respect to oxygen isotopes, and that the terrestrial magma ocean and lunar-forming material underwent turbulent mixing and equilibration in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact. This mixing may arise in the molten disk epoch between the impact and lunar accretion, lasting perhaps 102–103 yr.

It has long been thought that no single parent body could be the source of more than one of these three meteorite lithologies. This view is now being challenged by a variety of new measurements and theoretical models, including the discovery of primitive achondrites, paleomagnetic analyses of chondrites, thermal modeling of planetesimals, the discoveries of new metamorphosed chondrites and achondrites with affinities to some chondrite groups, and the possible identification of extant partially differentiated asteroids.

The spectrum of fluid motions in these experiments ranges from turbulence and inertial wave motions at high frequencies to global-scale zonal flows at low frequencies, and they result from the interplay between buoyant forces, rotational effects, melting and solidification, magnetic fields, and the spherical geometry of the core. This review summarizes strengths and limitations of laboratory fluid experiments for modeling core dynamics, identifies the key physical parameters, and highlights recent advances in understanding the complex flows that control the evolution of the core.

With a range of masses that allows these objects to retain moderate atmospheres and perhaps even plate tectonics, super-Earths may be habitable if they maintain long-term orbits in the habitable zones of their host stars.

abstract = {Chondrules, which are the major constituent of chondritic meteorites, are believed to have formed during brief, localized, repetitive melting of dust (probably caused by shock waves) in the protoplanetary disk around the early Sun. The ages of primitive chondrules in chondritic meteorites indicate that their formation started shortly after that of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (4,567.2 +/- 0.7 Myr ago) and lasted for about 3 Myr, which is consistent with the dissipation timescale for protoplanetary disks around young solar-mass stars. Here we report the 207Pb-206Pb ages of chondrules in the metal-rich CB (Bencubbin-like) carbonaceous chondrites Gujba (4,562.7 +/- 0.5 Myr) and Hammadah al Hamra 237 (4,562.8 +/- 0.9 Myr), which formed during a single-stage, highly energetic event. Both the relatively young ages and the single-stage formation of the CB chondrules are inconsistent with formation during a nebular shock wave. We conclude that chondrules and metal grains in the CB chondrites formed from a vapour-melt plume produced by a giant impact between planetary embryos after dust in the protoplanetary disk had largely dissipated. These findings therefore provide evidence for planet-sized objects in the earliest asteroid belt, as required by current numerical simulations of planet formation in the inner Solar System.},

abstract = {Given their tendency to be incorporated into the core during differentiation, the highly-siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle are thought to have been accreted as a `late veneer' after the end of the giant impact phase. Bottke et al (2010) proposed that the large Earth-to-Moon HSE abundance ratio can be explained if the late veneer was characterized by large (D = 1000-4000km) impactors. Here we simulate the evolution of the terrestrial planets during a stochastic late veneer phase from the end of accretion until the start of the late heavy bombardment {\~{}}500 Myr later. We show that a late veneer population of 0.05 Earth masses dominated by large (D {\textgreater} 1000km) bodies naturally delivers a {\~{}}0.01 Earth mass veneer to Earth, consistent with constraints. The eccentricities and inclinations of the terrestrial planets are excited by close encounters with the largest late veneer bodies. We find the best agreement with their post-veneer orbits if either a) the terrestrial planets' pre-veneer angular momentum deficit AMD{\_}0 was less than half of the current one AMD{\_}now, or b) AMD{\_}0 {\textless}= AMD{\_}now and the veneer was limited to smaller (D{\_}max {\textless}= 2000km) bodies. Veneer impacts on Venus, Earth and Mars were mostly accretionary but on Mercury and the Moon they were mostly erosive. In {\~{}}20{\%} of simulations an energetic impact occurred that could have removed {\textgreater}25{\%} of Mercury's mass, thereby increasing its iron mass fraction. We show that, due to the erosive nature of larger impacts, the Moon cannot accrete any material from objects larger than 500-1000km. The large Earth-to-Moon HSE abundance ratio is explained if the late veneer included large impactors (D {\textgreater}= 500-1000km) regardless of their size distribution, as long as most of Earth's veneer came from large bodies. The spin angular momenta imparted by stochastic late veneer impacts was far in excess of the current ones for Mercury and Venus.},

abstract = {This paper reviews our current understanding of terrestrial planets formation. The focus is on computer simulations of the dynamical aspects of the accretion process. Throughout the chapter, we combine the results of these theoretical models with geochemical, cosmochemical and chronological constraints, in order to outline a comprehensive scenario of the early evolution of our Solar System. Given that the giant planets formed first in the protoplanetary disk, we stress the sensitive dependence of the terrestrial planet accretion process on the orbital architecture of the giant planets and on their evolution. This suggests a great diversity among the terrestrial planets populations in extrasolar systems. Issues such as the cause for the different masses and accretion timescales between Mars and the Earth and the origin of water (and other volatiles) on our planet are discussed at depth.},

abstract = {Advances in our understanding of terrestrial planet formation have come from a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the ages and compositions of primitive meteorites with compositions similar to the Sun have helped to constrain the nature of the building blocks of planets. This information helps to guide numerical models for the three stages of planet formation from dust to planetesimals ({\~{}}10(6) y), followed by planetesimals to embryos (lunar to Mars-sized objects; few 10(6) y), and finally embryos to planets (10(7)-10(8) y). Defining the role of turbulence in the early nebula is a key to understanding the growth of solids larger than meter size. The initiation of runaway growth of embryos from planetesimals ultimately leads to the growth of large terrestrial planets via large impacts. Dynamical models can produce inner Solar System configurations that closely resemble our Solar System, especially when the orbital effects of large planets (Jupiter and Saturn) and damping mechanisms, such as gas drag, are included. Experimental studies of terrestrial planet interiors provide additional constraints on the conditions of differentiation and, therefore, origin. A more complete understanding of terrestrial planet formation might be possible via a combination of chemical and physical modeling, as well as obtaining samples and new geophysical data from other planets (Venus, Mars, or Mercury) and asteroids.},

The dynamic range of elevations is considerably smaller than those of Mars or the Moon. The most prominent feature is an extensive lowland at high northern latitudes that hosts the volcanic northern plains. Within this lowland is a broad topographic rise that experienced uplift after plains emplacement. The interior of the 1500-km-diameter Caloris impact basin has been modified so that part of the basin floor now stands higher than the rim. The elevated portion of the floor of Caloris appears to be part of a quasi-linear rise that extends for approximately half the planetary circumference at mid-latitudes. Collectively, these features imply that long-wavelength changes to Mercury's topography occurred after the earliest phases of the planet's geological history.},

abstract = {Unraveling the conditions at which Earth's metallic iron core formed yields important information about Earth's early accretion and differentiation history. Multi-variable statistical modeling of siderophile element partitioning between core-forming metallic liquids and silicate melts form the basis for physical models of core formation. While it seems clear that core segregation in a deep peridotitic magma ocean is generally consistent with many mantle siderophile element abundances, there is considerable disparity among extant physical models in terms of the key parameters of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity at which the core formed. Moreover, there is ongoing debate over whether simple single-stage equilibrium or more complex multi-stage accretion models are required by the partitioning data. Here we consider how variations in the statistical regression of partitioning data affect the outcomes of physical models for core formation. Taking extant experimental data sets for four well-studied siderophile elements (Ni, Co, W and V) as examples, we find that the regression model exerts a fundamental control on physical model outcomes. Further, the experimental data are currently too imprecise to discriminate among various single-stage and continuous core formation scenarios. Progress in the development of physical models requires better isolation of the independent variables that affect partition coefficients and verification of activity models at high pressure and temperature in order to reduce the global uncertainty in multi-variable statistical models.},

abstract = {The birth and infancy of Earth was a time of profound differentiation involving massive internal reorganization into core, mantle and proto-crust, all within a few hundred million years of solar system formation (t0). Physical and isotopic evidence indicate that the formation of iron-rich cores generally occurred very early in planetesimals, the building blocks of proto-Earth, within about 3 million years of t0. The final stages of terrestrial planetary accretion involved violent and tremendously energetic giant impacts among core-segregated Mercury- to Mars-sized objects and planetary embryos. As a consequence of impact heating, the early Earth was at times partially or wholly molten, increasing the likelihood for high-pressure and high-temperature equilibration among core- and mantle-forming materials. The Earth's silicate mantle harmoniously possesses abundance levels of the siderophile elements Ni and Co that can be reconciled by equilibration between iron alloy and silicate at conditions comparable to those expected for a deep magma ocean. Solidification of a deep magma ocean possibly involved crystal–melt segregation at high pressures, but subsequent convective stirring of the mantle could have largely erased nascent layering. However, primitive upper mantle rocks apparently have some nonchondritic major and trace element refractory lithophile element ratios that can be plausibly linked to early mantle differentiation of ultra-high-pressure mantle phases. The geochemical effects of crystal fractionation in a deep magma ocean are partly constrained by high-pressure experimentation. Comparison between compositional models for the primitive convecting mantle and bulk silicate Earth generally allows, and possibly favors, 10–15{\%} total fractionation of a deep mantle assemblage comprised predominantly of Mg-perovskite and with minor but geochemically important amounts of Ca-perovskite and ferropericlase. Long-term isolation of such a crystal pile is generally consistent with isotopic constraints for time-integrated Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios in the modern upper mantle and might account for the characteristics of some mantle isotope reservoirs. Although much remains to be learned about the earliest formative period in the Earth's development, a convergence of theoretical, physical, isotopic and geochemical arguments is beginning to yield a self-consistent portrait of the infant Earth.},

In this TREESPH code, hydrodynamic properties are determined using a Monte Carlo-like approach known as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Unlike most previous implementations of SPH, gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical tree algorithm. Multiple expansions are used to approximate the potential of distant groups of particles, reducing the cost per step. More significantly, the improvement in efficiency is achieved without the introduction of a grid. A unification of SPH with the hierarchical tree method is a natural way of allowing for larger N within a Lagrangian framework. The data structures used to manipulate the grouping of particles can be applied directly to certain aspects of the SPH calculation.},

@article{Pierazzo1997,
abstract = {The production of melt and vapor is an important process in impact cratering events. Because significant melting and vaporization do not occur in impacts at velocities currently achievable in the laboratory, a detailed study of the production of melt and vapor in planetary impact events is carried out with hydrocode simulations. Sandia's two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrocode CSQ was used to estimate the amount of melt and vapor produced for widely varying initial conditions: 10 to 80 km/sec for impact velocity, 0.2 to 10 km for the projectile radius. Runs with different materials demonstrate the material dependency of the final result. These results should apply to any size projectile (for given impact velocity and material), since the results can be dynamically scaled so long as gravity is unimportant in affecting the early-time flow. In contrast with the assumptions of previous analytical models, a clear difference in shape, impact-size dependence, and depth of burial has been found between the melt regions and the isobaric core. In particular, the depth of the isobaric core is not a good representation of the depth of the melt regions, which form deeper in the target. While near-surface effects cause the computed melt region shapes to look like “squashed spheres” the spherical shape is still a good analytical analog. One of the goals of melt production studies is to find proper scaling laws to infer melt production for any impact event of interest. We tested the point source limit scaling law for melt volumes ($\mu$ = 0.55–0.6) proposed by M. D. Bjorkman and K. A. Holsapple (1987,Int. J. Impact Eng.5, 155–163). Our results indicate that the point source limit concept does not apply to melt and vapor production. Rather, melt and vapor production follows an energy scaling law ($\mu$ = 0.67), in good agreement with previous results of T. J. Ahrens and J. D. O'Keefe [1977, inImpact and Explosion Cratering(D. J. Roddy, R. O. Pepin, and R. B. Merrill, Eds.), pp. 639–656, Pergamon Press, Elmsford, NY]. Finally we tested the accuracy of our melt production calculation against a terrestrial dataset compiled by R. A. F. Grieve and M. J. Cintala (1992,Meteorities27, 526–538). The hydrocode melt volumes are in good agreement with the estimated volumes of that set of terrestrial craters on crystalline basements. At present there is no good model for melt production from impact craters on sedimentary targets.},

@article{Pierazzo2000,
abstract = {Hydrocode modeling is a fundamental tool for the study of melt production in planetary impact events. Until recently, however, numerical modeling of impacts for melt production studies has been limited to vertical impacts. We present the first results of the investigation of melt production in oblique impacts. Simulations were carried out using Sandia's three-dimensional hydrocode CTH, coupled to the SESAME equation of state. While keeping other impact parameters constant, the calculations span impact angles (measured from the surface) from 90° (vertical impact) to 15°. The results show that impact angle affects the strength and distribution of the shock wave generated in the impact. As a result, both the isobaric core and the regions of melting in the target appear asymmetric and concentrated in the downrange, shallower portion of the target. The use of a pressure-decay power law (which describes pressure as function of linear distance from the impact point) to reconstruct the region of melting and vaporization is therefore complicated by the asymmetry of the shock wave. As an analog to the pressure decay versus distance from the impact point, we used a “volumetric pressure decay,” where the pressure decay is modeled as a function of volume of target material shocked at or above the given shock pressure. We find that the volumetric pressure decay exponent is almost constant for impact angles from 90° to 30°, dropping by about a factor of two for a 15° impact. In the range of shock pressures at which most materials of geologic interest melt or begin to vaporize, we find that the volume of impact melt decreases by at most 20{\%} for impacts from 90° down to 45°. Below 45°, however, the amount of melt in the target decreases rapidly with impact angle. Compared to the vertical case, the reduction in volume of melt is about 50{\%} for impacts at 30° and more than 90{\%} for a 15° impact. These estimates do not include possible melting due to shear heating, which can contribute to the amount of melt production especially in very oblique impacts. Studies of melt production in vertical impacts suggest an energy scaling law in agreement with the point source limit. An energy scaling law, however, does not seem to hold for oblique impacts, even when the impact velocity is substituted by its vertical component. However, we find that for impact angles between about 30° and 90° (a range that includes 75{\%} of impact events on planetary surfaces) the volume of melt is directly proportional to the volume of the transient crater generated by the impact.},

Many authors have proposed mechanisms by which Mars could have lost (or sequestered) an earlier, thicker atmosphere but none of these proposals has gained general acceptance. Here we examine the process of atmospheric erosion by impacts and show that it may account for an early episode of atmosphere loss from Mars. On the basis of this model, the primordial atmospheric pressure on Mars must have been in the vicinity of 1 bar, barring other sources or sinks of CO2. Current impact fluxes are too small to erode significantly the present martian atmosphere.},

abstract = {The isotopic composition of neon and xenon measured in MORB glasses confirm significant deviations from atmospheric values. These are (1)21Ne excesses which are attributed to nucleogenic reactions in the mantle: (2) 20Ne/22Ne ratios higher than the air ratio interpreted as an evidence for the occurrence of solar-type Ne at depth: (3)129Xe and131–136Xe excesses, attributed to both extinct (129I and244Pu) and present (238U) radioactivities. Ne and Xe isotopic signatures in the mantle can hardly be explained in the framework of classical models for the atmospheric evolution (which postulate a mantle origin for atmospheric gases) and appeal for at least two sources of gases. Ne isotopic differences between air and MORB appear too large to be accounted for by any reasonable fractionation process in the mantle. They imply either fractionation of neon during hydrodynamic escape of a primary atmosphere or different degrees of mixing between primordial Ne components, which, in turn imply isolation of the surface reservoir (air) and deep reservoir (mantle) from the accretional period (except for mantle outgassing through volcanism, the contribution of which is 41{\%} at best for20Ne). 129I ￼ 129 Xe, 244 Pu ￼ 238 U ￼ 136 Xe systematics for atmospheric and MORB-type xenon suggest that either atmospheric gases derived from a source whose formation was delayed (⩾ 17 Ma) with respect to the mean accretion time of the mantle source and/or atmospheric gases and MORB-type gases derived from chemically distinct sources. These features are consistent with heterogeneous accretion models for the Earth. Volatile degassing was probably contemporaneous to accretional events, following impact degassing, and might have been most efficient during the late stages of Earth formation.},

abstract = {Shock wave and thermodynamic data for rock-forming and volatile-bearing minerals are used to determine minimum impact velocities (vcr) and minimum impact pressures (pcr) required to form a primary H2O atmosphere during planetary accretion from chondritelike planetesimals. The escape of initially released water from an accreting planet is controlled by the dehydration efficiency. Since different planetary surface porosities will result from formation of a regolith, vcr and pcr can vary from 1.5 to 5.8 km/sec and from 90 to 600 kbar, respectively, for target porosities between 0 and ∼45{\%}. On the basis of experimental data, hydration rates for forsterite and enstatite are derived. For a global regolith layer on the Earth's surface, the maximum hydration rate equals 6 × 1010 g H2O sec−1 during accretion of the Earth. Attenuation of impact-induced shock pressure is modeled to the extent that the amount of released water as a function of projectile radius, impact velocity, weight fraction of water in the target, target porosity, and dehydration efficiency can be estimated. The two primary processes considered are the impact release of water bound in hydrous minerals (e.g., serpentine) and the subsequent reincorporation of free water by hydration of forsterite and enstatite. These processes are described in terms of model calculations for the accretion of the Earth. Parameters which lead to a primary atmosphere/hydrosphere are: an accretion time of ⪅ 1.6 × 108years, the use of an accretion model defined by Weidenschilling (1974, 1976), a mean planetesimal radius of 0.5 km, a hydration rate of 6 × 1010 g H2O sec−1 inferred from a mean porosity of ∼ 10{\%} for the upper 1 km of the accreting Earth, and values for the dehydration efficiency, DE, of 0.55 and 0.07 for the maximum and minimum pressure decay model, respectively. Conditions which prohibit the formation of a primary atmosphere include an accretion time much longer than 1.6 × 108 years, a hydration rate for forsterite and enstatite well in excess of 6 × 1010 g H2O sec−1, and a dehydration efficiency DE {\textless} 0.07. We conclude that the concept of dehydration efficiency is of dominant importance in determining the degree to which an accreting planet acquires an atmosphere during its formation.},

The initial spin state of terrestrial planets is determined at this stage. We statistically investigate the spin parameters of terrestrial planets assembled from protoplanets using N-body simulations. As initial conditions, we adopt the oligarchic growth model of protoplanets. For the standard disk model, typically two Earth-sized planets form in the terrestrial planet region. We find that the spin angular velocity of the planets is well expressed by a Gaussian distribution, and their obliquity is well expressed by an isotropic distribution. The typical spin angular velocity is given by the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability under the assumption of perfect accretion in collisions. We show the dependencies of the spin parameters on the initial protoplanet system parameters. The initial orbital separation and velocity anisotropy of protoplanets barely affect the spin parameters. The bulk density of protoplanets does not affect the obliquity distribution, while the spin angular velocity increases with the bulk density.},

abstract = {The 182Hf–182W systematics of meteoritic and planetary samples provide firm constraints on the chronology of the accretion and earliest evolution of asteroids and terrestrial planets and lead to the following succession and duration of events in the earliest solar system. Formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) at 4568.3 ± 0.7 Ma was followed by the accretion and differentiation of the parent bodies of some magmatic iron meteorites within less than ∼1 Myr. Chondrules from H chondrites formed 1.7 ± 0.7 Myr after CAIs, about contemporaneously with chondrules from L and LL chondrites as shown by their 26Al–26Mg ages. Some magmatism on the parent bodies of angrites, eucrites, and mesosiderites started as soon as ∼3 Myr after CAI formation and may have continued until ∼10 Myr. A similar timescale is obtained for the high-temperature metamorphic evolution of the H chondrite parent body. Thermal modeling combined with these age constraints reveals that the different thermal histories of meteorite parent bodies primarily reflect their initial abundance of 26Al, which is determined by their accretion age. Impact-related processes were important in the subsequent evolution of asteroids but do not appear to have induced large-scale melting. For instance, Hf–W ages for eucrite metals postdate CAI formation by ∼20 Myr and may reflect impact-triggered thermal metamorphism in the crust of the eucrite parent body. Likewise, the Hf–W systematics of some non-magmatic iron meteorites were modified by impact-related processes but the timing of this event(s) remains poorly constrained. The strong fractionation of lithophile Hf from siderophile W during core formation makes the Hf–W system an ideal chronometer for this major differentiation event. However, for larger planets such as the terrestrial planets the calculated Hf–W ages are particularly sensitive to the occurrence of large impacts, the degree to which impactor cores re-equilibrated with the target mantle during large collisions, and changes in the metal-silicate partition coefficients of W due to changing fO2 in differentiating planetary bodies. Calculated core formation ages for Mars range from 0 to 20 Myr after CAI formation and currently cannot distinguish between scenarios where Mars formed by runaway growth and where its formation was more protracted. Tungsten model ages for core formation in Earth range from ∼30 Myr to {\textgreater}100 Myr after CAIs and hence do not provide a unique age for the formation of Earth. However, the identical 182W/184W ratios of the lunar and terrestrial mantles provide powerful evidence that the Moon-forming giant impact and the final stage of Earth's core formation occurred after extinction of 182Hf (i.e., more than ∼50 Myr after CAIs), unless the Hf/W ratios of the bulk silicate Moon and Earth are identical to within less than ∼10{\%}. Furthermore, the identical 182W/184W of the lunar and terrestrial mantles is difficult to explain unless either the Moon consists predominantly of terrestrial material or the W in the proto-lunar magma disk isotopically equilibrated with the Earth's mantle. Hafnium–tungsten chronometry also provides constraints on the duration of magma ocean solidification in terrestrial planets. Variations in the 182W/184W ratios of martian meteorites reflect an early differentiation of the martian mantle during the effective lifetime of 182Hf. In contrast, no 182W variations exist in the lunar mantle, demonstrating magma ocean solidification later than ∼60 Myr, in agreement with 147Sm–143Nd ages for ferroan anorthosites. The Moon-forming giant impact most likely erased any evidence of a prior differentiation of Earth's mantle, consistent with a 146Sm–142Nd age of 50–200 Myr for the earliest differentiation of Earth's mantle. However, the Hf–W chronology of the formation of Earth's core and the Moon-forming impact is difficult to reconcile with the preservation of 146Sm–142Nd evidence for an early ({\textless}30 Myr after CAIs) differentiation of a chondritic Earth's mantle. Instead, the combined 182W–142Nd evidence suggests that bulk Earth may have superchondritic Sm/Nd and Hf/W ratios, in which case formation of its core must have terminated more than ∼42 Myr after formation of CAIs, consistent with the Hf–W age for the formation of the Moon.},

The high-precision Kr and Xe isotope data together suggest that Earth's interior acquired its volatiles from accretionary material similar to average carbonaceous chondrites and that the noble gases in Earth's atmosphere and oceans are dominantly derived from later volatile capture rather than impact degassing or outgassing of the solid Earth during its main accretionary stage.},

abstract = {The H/C mass ratio of the Earth's exosphere, which consists of the fluid envelopes plus the crust, is 1.95 ± 0.15. In contrast, the H/C ratios of undegassed oceanic basalts are significantly lower, ranging from 1.2 down to 0.05. Reconstruction of source H/C ratios by accounting for H/C fractionation during partial melting and addition of carbon-enriched low-degree partial melts suggests that the source regions of MORB have H/C ratios in the range of 0.75 ± 0.25 and those of OIB have ratios in the interval 0.5 ± 0.3. Combining these estimates with plausible limits on the relative proportions of the OIB and MORB sources indicates that the total H inventory of the mantle is equivalent to between 0.2 and 1.6 times the H in the exosphere, assuming that there are no significant hidden reservoirs unsampled by oceanic basalts. Combining the H contents and H/C ratios of the mantle and the exosphere suggests that the H/C ratio of the bulk silicate Earth, (H/C)BSE, is 0.99 ± 0.42, significantly greater than the H/C ratio of chondrites, which have H/C ratios no greater than 0.55. The superchondritic (H/C)BSE ratio likely results from preferential sequestration of C in the core, though it may also partly reflect a cometary origin for some portion of the BSE volatile inventory. The high (H/C)BSE ratio, combined with a D/H ratio similar to chondrites, argues strongly that the BSE volatile inventory is not chiefly derived from a late veneer. The large difference in H/C ratio between the exosphere and the mantle could reflect early Earth processes such as preferential retention of C in a crystallizing magma ocean in reduced phases such as diamond, or selective loss of a massive CO2-rich atmosphere. Alternatively, it may have arisen by enhanced subduction of carbon relative to hydrogen. If the latter is the case, carbon in the mantle is likely dominantly recycled.},

abstract = {Radioactive decay of uranium and thorium produces 4He, whereas 3He in the Earth's mantle is not produced by radioactive decay and was only incorporated during accretion-that is, it is primordial. 3He/4He ratios in many ocean-island basalts (OIBs) that erupt at hotspot volcanoes, such as Hawaii and Iceland, can be up to sixfold higher than in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). This is inferred to be the result of outgassing by melt production at mid-ocean ridges in conjunction with radiogenic ingrowth of 4He, which has led to a volatile-depleted upper mantle (MORB source) with low 3He concentrations and low 3He/4He ratios. Consequently, high 3He/4He ratios in OIBs are conventionally viewed as evidence for an undegassed, primitive mantle source, which is sampled by hot, buoyantly upwelling deep-mantle plumes. However, this conventional model provides no viable explanation of why helium concentrations and elemental ratios of He/Ne and He/Ar in OIBs are an order of magnitude lower than in MORBs. This has been described as the 'helium concentration paradox' and has contributed to a long-standing controversy about the structure and dynamics of the Earth's mantle. Here we show that the helium concentration paradox, as well as the full range of noble-gas concentrations observed in MORB and OIB glasses, can self-consistently be explained by disequilibrium open-system degassing of the erupting magma. We show that a higher CO2 content in OIBs than in MORBs leads to more extensive degassing of helium in OIB magmas and that noble gases in OIB lavas can be derived from a largely undegassed primitive mantle source.},

abstract = {At the final stage of terrestrial planet formation, known as the giant impact stage, a few tens of Mars-sized protoplanets collide with one another to form terrestrial planets. Almost all previous studies on the orbital and accretional evolution of protoplanets in this stage have been based on the assumption of perfect accretion, where two colliding protoplanets always merge. However, recent impact simulations have shown that collisions among protoplanets are not always merging events, that is, two colliding protoplanets sometimes move apart after the collision (hit-and-run collision). As a first step toward studying the effects of such imperfect accretion of protoplanets on terrestrial planet formation, we investigated the merging criteria for collisions of rocky protoplanets. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic method, we performed more than 1000 simulations of giant impacts with various parameter sets, such as the mass ratio of protoplanets, $\gamma$, the total mass of two protoplanets, M T, the impact angle, $\theta$, and the impact velocity, v imp. We investigated the critical impact velocity, v cr, at the transition between merging and hit-and-run collisions. We found that the normalized critical impact velocity, v cr/v esc, depends on $\gamma$ and $\theta$, but does not depend on M T, where v esc is the two-body escape velocity. We derived a simple formula for v cr/v esc as a function of $\gamma$ and $\theta$ (Equation (16)), and applied it to the giant impact events obtained by N-body calculations in the previous studies. We found that 40{\%} of these events should not be merging events.},

abstract = {Early in terrestrial planet evolution energetic impact, radiodecay, and core formation may have created one or more whole or partial silicate mantle magma oceans. The time to mantle solidification and then to clement surface conditions allowing liquid water is highly dependent upon heat flux from the planetary surface through a growing primitive atmosphere. Here we model the time to clement conditions for whole and partial magma oceans on the Earth and Mars, and the resulting silicate mantle volatile compositions. Included in our calculations are partitioning of water and carbon dioxide between solidifying mantle cumulate mineral assemblages, evolving liquid compositions, and a growing atmosphere. We find that small initial volatile contents (0.05 wt.{\%} H2O, 0.01 wt.{\%} CO2) can produce atmospheres in excess of 100 bars, and that mantle solidification is 98{\%} complete in less than 5 Myr for all magma oceans investigated on both Earth and Mars, and less than 100,000 yr for low-volatile magma oceans. Subsequent cooling to clement surface conditions occurs in five to tens of Ma, underscoring the likelihood of serial magma oceans and punctuated clement conditions in the early planets. Cumulate mantles are volatile-bearing and stably stratified following solidification, inhibiting the onset of thermal convection but allowing for further water and carbon emissions from volcanoes even in the absence of plate tectonics. Models thus produce a new hypothetical starting point for mantle evolution in the terrestrial planets.},

@article{Dauphas2011,
abstract = {Terrestrial planets are thought to have formed through collisions between large planetary embryos of diameter ∼1,000-5,000 km. For Earth, the last of these collisions involved an impact by a Mars-size embryo that formed the Moon 50-150 million years (Myr) after the birth of the Solar System. Although model simulations of the growth of terrestrial planets can reproduce the mass and dynamical parameters of the Earth and Venus, they fall short of explaining the small size of Mars. One possibility is that Mars was a planetary embryo that escaped collision and merging with other embryos. To assess this idea, it is crucial to know Mars' accretion timescale, which can be investigated using the (182)Hf-(182)W decay system in shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite meteorites. Nevertheless, this timescale remains poorly constrained owing to a large uncertainty associated with the Hf/W ratio of the Martian mantle and as a result, contradicting timescales have been reported that range between 0 and 15 Myr (refs 6-10). Here we show that Mars accreted very rapidly and reached about half of its present size in only 1.8(+0.9)(-1.0) Myr or less, which is consistent with a stranded planetary embryo origin. We have found a well-defined correlation between the Th/Hf and (176)Hf/(177)Hf ratios in chondrites that reflects remobilization of Lu and Th during parent-body processes. Using this relationship, we estimate the Hf/W ratio in Mars' mantle to be 3.51 ± 0.45. This value is much more precise than previous estimates, which ranged between 2.6 and 5.0 (ref. 6), and lifts the large uncertainty that plagued previous estimates of the age of Mars. Our results also demonstrate that Mars grew before dissipation of the nebular gas when ∼100-km planetesimals, such as the parent bodies of chondrites, were still being formed. Mars' accretion occurred early enough to allow establishment of a magma ocean powered by decay of (26)Al.},

abstract = {Results of about 100 hydrodynamic simulations of potential Moon-forming impacts are presented, focusing on the “late impact” scenario in which the lunar forming impact occurs near the very end of Earth's accretion (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708–712). A new equation of state is utilized that includes a treatment of molecular vapor (“M-ANEOS”; Melosh, 2000, in: Proc. Lunar Planet. Sci. Conf. 31st, p. 1903). The sensitivity of impact outcome to collision conditions is assessed, in particular how the mass, angular momentum, composition and origin (target vs. impactor) of the material placed into circumterrestrial orbit vary with impact angle, speed, impactor-to-target mass ratio, and initial thermal state of the colliding objects. The most favorable conditions for producing a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk involve collisions with an impact angle near 45 degrees and an impactor velocity at infinity {\textless}4 km/sec. For a total mass and angular momentum near to that of the current Earth–Moon system, such impacts typically place about a lunar mass of material into orbits exterior to the Roche limit, with the orbiting material composed of 10 to 30{\%} vapor by mass. In all cases, the vast majority of the orbiting material originates from the impactor, consistent with previous findings. By mapping the end fate (escaping, orbiting, or in the planet) of each particle and the peak temperature it experiences during the impact onto the figure of the initial objects, it is shown that in the successful collisions, the impactor material that ends up in orbit is primarily that portion of the object that was heated the least, having avoided direct collision with the Earth. Using these and previous results as a guide, a continuous suite of impact conditions intermediate to the “late impact” (Canup and Asphaug, 2001, Nature 412, 708–712) and “early Earth” (Cameron, 2000, in: Canup, R.M., Righter, K. (Eds.), Origin of the Earth and Moon, pp. 133–144; 2001, Meteorit. Planet. Sci. 36, 9–22) scenarios is identified that should also produce iron-poor, ∼lunar-sized satellites and a system angular momentum similar to that of the Earth–Moon system. Among these, those that leave the Earth {\textgreater}95{\%} accreted after the Moon-forming impact are favored here, implying a giant impactor mass between 0.11 and 0.14 Earth masses.},

abstract = {It is assumed in models of terrestrial planet formation that colliding bodies simply merge. From this the dynamical and chemical properties (and habitability) of finished planets have been computed, and our own and other planetary systems compared to the results of these calculations. But efficient mergers may be exceptions to the rule, for the similar-sized collisions (SSCs) that dominate terrestrial planet formation, simply because moderately off-axis SSCs are grazing; their centers of mass overshoot. In a “hit and run” collision the smaller body narrowly avoids accretion and is profoundly deformed and altered by gravitational and mechanical torques, shears, tides, and impact shocks. Consequences to the larger body are minor in inverse proportion to its relative mass. Over the possible impact angles, hit-and-run is the most common outcome for impact velocities vimp between ∼1.2∼1.2 and 2.7 times the mutual escape velocity vesc between similar-sized planets. Slower collisions are usually accretionary, and faster SSCs are erosive or disruptive, and thus the prevalence of hit-and-run is sensitive to the velocity regime during epochs of accretion. Consequences of hit-and-run are diverse. If barely grazing, the target strips much of the exterior from the impactor—any atmosphere and ocean, much of the crust—and unloads its deep interior from hydrostatic pressure for about an hour. If closer to head-on (∼30–45°)(∼30–45°) a hit-and-run can cause the impactor core to plow through the target mantle, graze the target core, and emerge as a chain of diverse new planetoids on escaping trajectories. A hypothesis is developed for the diversity of next-largest bodies (NLBs) in an accreting planetary system—the bodies from which asteroids and meteorites derive. Because nearly all the NLBs eventually get accreted by the largest (Venus and Earth in our terrestrial system) or by the Sun, or otherwise lost, those we see today have survived the attrition of merger, evolving with each close call towards denser and volatile-poor bulk composition. This hypothesis would explain the observed density diversity of differentiated asteroids, and of dwarf planets beyond Neptune, in terms of episodic global-scale losses of rock or ice mantles, respectively. In an event similar to the Moon-forming giant impact, Mercury might have lost its original crust and upper mantle when it emerged from a modest velocity hit and run collision with a larger embryo or planet. In systems with super-Earths, profound diversity and diminished habitability is predicted among the unaccreted Earth-mass planets, as many of these will have be stripped of their atmospheres, oceans and crusts.},

We report the results of 10 simulations beginning with 22–50 initial planetary embryos spanning the range 0.5–1.5 AU, each with an initial mass of 0.04–0.13M⊕. Collisions are treated as inelastic mergers. We follow the evolution of each system for 2×108 years at which time a few terrestrial type planets remain. On average, our simulations produced two planets larger than 0.5M⊕ in the terrestrial region (1 simulation with one m≥0.5M⊕ planet, 8 simulations with two m≥0.5M⊕ planets, and 1 simulation with three m≥0.5M⊕ planets). These Earth-like planets have eccentricities and orbital spacing considerably larger than the terrestrial planets of comparable mass (e.g., Earth and Venus). We also examine the angular momentum contributions of each collision to the final spin angular momentum of a planet, with an emphasis on the type of impact which is believed to have triggered the formation of the Earth's Moon. There was an average of two impacts per simulation that contributed more angular momentum to a planet than is currently present in the Earth/Moon system. We determine the spin angular momentum states of the growing planets by summing the contributions from each collisional encounter. Our results show that the spin angular momentum states of the final planets are generally the result of contributions made by the last few large impacts. Our results suggest that the current angular momentum of the Earth/Moon system may be the result of more than one large impact rather than a single impact. Further, upon suffering their first collision, the planetary embryos in our simulations are spinning rapidly throughout the final accretion of the planets, suggesting the proto-Earth may have been rotating rapidly prior to the Moon-forming impact event.},

We consider a few candidate impacts advocated by recent works, directly comparing simulations performed at varying resolutions and with both numerical methods and their predictions for the properties of resulting protolunar disks. For a fixed set of impact conditions, simulations with either method and with different resolutions yield very similar results for the initial impact and the first few hours of the post-impact period. The subsequent disk properties in the ∼5–20 h time period can vary substantially from case-to-case, depending on the orbits of and mutual interactions between large bound clumps of ejecta that often form after the initial impact. After such clumps have completed at least one orbit (which typically requires ∼25–50 h), the predicted protolunar disk mass and its angular momentum converge to within about 10{\%} for simulations of very similar impact conditions using different resolutions or methods. The disks produced by the CTH simulations are consistently about 10{\%} less massive than those produced by SPH simulations, due presumably to inherent differences between the codes. The two methods predict broadly similar values for the fraction of the protolunar disk that originates from the target vs. the impactor, and for the initial disk radial surface density and temperature profiles.},

abstract = {Prior models of lunar-forming impacts assume that both the impactor and the target protoearth were not rotating prior to the Moon-forming event. However, planet formation models suggest that such objects would have been rotating rapidly during the late stages of terrestrial accretion. In this paper I explore the effects of pre-impact rotation on impact outcomes through more than 100 hydrodynamical simulations that consider a range of impactor masses, impact angles and impact speeds. Pre-impact rotation, particularly in the target protoearth, can substantially alter collisional outcomes and leads to a more diverse set of final planet–disk systems than seen previously. However, the subset of these impacts that are also lunar-forming candidates—i.e. that produce a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk—have properties similar to those determined for collisions of non-rotating objects [Canup, R.M., Asphaug, E., 2001. Nature 412, 708–712; Canup, R.M., 2004a. Icarus 168, 433–456]. With or without pre-impact rotation, a lunar-forming impact requires an impact angle near 45 degrees, together with a low impact velocity that is not more than 10{\%} larger than the Earth's escape velocity, and produces a disk containing up to about two lunar masses that is composed predominantly of material originating from the impactor. The most significant differences in the successful cases involving pre-impact spin occur for impacts into a retrograde rotating protoearth, which allow for larger impactors (containing up to 20{\%} of Earth's mass) and provide an improved match with the current Earth–Moon system angular momentum compared to prior results. The most difficult state to reconcile with the Moon is that of a rapidly spinning, low-obliquity protoearth before the giant impact, as these cases produce disks that are not massive enough to yield the Moon.},

abstract = {Mars is likely to be a planetary embryo formed through collisions with planetesimals, which can explain its small mass and rapid formation timescale obtained from 182Hf–182W chronometry. In the classical theory of planet formation, the final embryo mass is determined only by the solid surface density. However, embryos can stir surrounding planetesimals, leading to fragmentation through erosive (cratering) collisions. We find that radial drift of small fragments can drastically reduce the solid surface density. On the other hand, embryo growth is accelerated by fragment accretion. Since collisional fragmentation efficiency depends on the initial size of planetesimals, the final embryo mass and its growth time are determined by the initial planetesimal size and disk surface density. We have investigated the effect of these two parameters on the mass of Mars and the predicted radiogenic excess of 182W in the martian mantle. Two scenarios can explain the rapid formation of small Mars: (i) it formed by accretion of small planetesimals in a massive disk or (ii) it formed from large planetesimals but its growth was arrested by the inward then outward migration of Jupiter. Taking into account all constraints, we conclude that Mars is likely to have formed in a massive disk of about ∼0.1 solar mass from planetesimals smaller than ∼10 km in radius. Such small planetesimal size cannot explain core accretion of Jupiter, suggesting that there may have been a heliocentric gradient in planetesimal size in the solar nebula.},

abstract = {Heavy noble gases can record long-lasting heterogeneities in the mantle, because Ne, Ar, and Xe isotopes are produced from extant (U, Th, K) and extinct (129I and 244Pu) radionuclides. However, the presence of ubiquitous atmospheric contamination in basalts, particularly for ocean island basalts (OIBs) that sample the Earth's deep mantle, have largely hampered precise characterization of the mantle source compositions. Here we present new high-precision noble gas data from gas-rich basalts erupted along the Rochambeau Rift (RR) in the northwestern corner of the Lau Basin. The strong influence of a deep mantle plume in the Rochambeau source is apparent from low 4He/3He ratios down to 25,600 (3He/4He of 28.1RA). We find that the Rochambeau source is characterized by low ratios of radiogenic to non-radiogenic nuclides of Ne, Ar, and Xe (i.e., low 21Ne/22Ne, 40Ar/36Ar, and 129Xe/130Xe) compared to the mantle source of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). High-precision xenon isotopic measurements indicate that the lower 129Xe/130Xe ratios in the Rochambeau source cannot be explained solely by mixing atmospheric xenon with MORB-type xenon; nor can fission-produced Xe be added to MORB Xe to produce the compositions seen in the Rochambeau basalts. Deconvolution of fissiogenic xenon isotopes demonstrate a higher proportion of Pu- fission derived Xe in the Rochambeau source compared to the MORB source. Therefore, both I/Xe and Pu/Xe ratios are different between OIB and MORB sources. Our observations require heterogeneous volatile accretion and a lower degree of processing for the plume source compared to the MORB source. Since differences in 129Xe/130Xe ratios have to be produced while 129I is still alive, OIB and MORB sources must have been processed at different rates for the first 100 million years (Myr) of Solar System history, and subsequent to this period, the two reservoirs have not been homogenized. In combination with recent results from the Iceland plume, our noble gas observations require the formation and preservation of less-degassed, early-formed (pre-4.45 Ga) heterogeneities in the Earth's deep mantle. Consequently, the primitive noble gas reservoir sampled by mantle plumes cannot be created solely through sequestration of recycled slabs or undegassed melts at the base of the mantle during the past 4.4 Ga. Finally, if the more primitive, less degassed heterogeneities reside in the Large Low Shear Wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), then LLSVPs must be long-lasting features of the deep mantle and are not composed exclusively of recycled material.},

@article{Canup2012,
abstract = {In the giant impact theory, the Moon formed from debris ejected into an Earth-orbiting disk by the collision of a large planet with the early Earth. Prior impact simulations predict that much of the disk material originates from the colliding planet. However, Earth and the Moon have essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions. This has been a challenge for the impact theory, because the impactor's composition would have likely differed from that of Earth. We simulated impacts involving larger impactors than previously considered. We show that these can produce a disk with the same composition as the planet's mantle, consistent with Earth-Moon compositional similarities. Such impacts require subsequent removal of angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system through a resonance with the Sun as recently proposed.},

abstract = {The Moon is generally believed to have formed from debris ejected by a large off-centre collision with the early Earth. The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth-Moon system has proved difficult. Previous works found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller-and thus more likely-object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

abstract = {New W isotope data for lunar metals demonstrate that the Moon formed late in isotopic equilibrium with the bulk silicate Earth (BSE). On this basis, lunar Sr isotope data are used to define the former composition of the Earth and hence the Rb-Sr age of the Moon, which is 4.48+/-0.02Ga, or 70-110Ma (million years) after the start of the Solar System. This age is significantly later than had been deduced from W isotopes based on model assumptions or isotopic effects now known to be cosmogenic. The Sr age is in excellent agreement with earlier estimates based on the time of lunar Pb loss and the age of the early lunar crust (4.46+/-0.04Ga). Similar ages for the BSE are recorded by xenon and lead-lead, providing evidence of catastrophic terrestrial degassing, atmospheric blow-off and significant late core formation accompanying the ca 100Ma giant impact. Agreement between the age of the Moon based on the Earth's Rb/Sr and the lead-lead age of the Moon is consistent with no major losses of moderately volatile elements from the Earth during the giant impact. The W isotopic composition of the BSE can be explained by end member models of (i) gradual accretion with a mean life of roughly 35Ma or (ii) rapid growth with a mean life of roughly 10Ma, followed by a significant hiatus prior to the giant impact. The former assumes that approximately 60 per cent of the incoming metal from impactors is added directly to the core during accretion. The latter includes complete mixing of all the impactor material into the BSE during accretion. The identical W isotopic composition of the Moon and the BSE limits the amount of material that can be added as a late veneer to the Earth after the giant impact to less than 0.3+/-0.3 per cent of ordinary chondrite or less than 0.5+/-0.6 per cent CI carbonaceous chondrite based on their known W isotopic compositions. Neither of these on their own is sufficient to explain the inventories of both refractory siderophiles such as platinum group elements and rhenium, and volatiles such as sulphur, carbon and water.},

This demonstrates that late addition of chondritic material was a common feature of all differentiated planets and planetesimals, irrespective of when they accreted; occurring ≤5 to ≥150 million years after the formation of the solar system. Parent-body size played a role in producing variations in absolute HSE abundances among these bodies; however, the oxidation state of the body exerted the major control by influencing the extent to which late-accreted material was mixed into the silicate mantle rather than removed to the core.},

abstract = {Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (ref. 1) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only ∼100,000 years (ref. 2). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration. The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later, and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (1 au is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 au, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 au; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 au and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.},

abstract = {Stars form with gaseous and dusty circumstellar envelopes, which rapidly settle into disks that eventually give rise to planetary systems. Understanding the process by which these disks evolve is paramount in developing an accurate theory of planet formation that can account for the variety of planetary systems discovered so far. The formation of Earth-like planets through collisional accumulation of rocky objects within a disk has mainly been explored in theoretical and computational work in which post-collision ejecta evolution typically is ignored, although recent work has considered the fate of such material. Here we report observations of a young, Sun-like star (TYC 8241 2652 1) where infrared flux from post-collisional ejecta has decreased drastically, by a factor of about 30, over a period of less than two years. The star seems to have gone from hosting substantial quantities of dusty ejecta, in a region analogous to where the rocky planets orbit in the Solar System, to retaining at most a meagre amount of cooler dust. Such a phase of rapid ejecta evolution has not been previously predicted or observed, and no currently available physical model satisfactorily explains the observations.},

abstract = {A common origin for the Moon and Earth is required by their identical isotopic composition. However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

We present static laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments up to 200 GPa using synchrotron-based fast x-ray diffraction as a primary melting diagnostic. When extrapolating to higher pressures, we conclude that the melting temperature of iron at the inner core boundary is 6230 ± 500 kelvin. This estimation favors a high heat flux at the core-mantle boundary with a possible partial melting of the mantle.},

abstract = {The amount of gas imparted to the atmosphere by an interaction of an impactor with a planet is estimated. The interaction of an impactor with a planet is described. The enthalpy of the gas, the kinetic energy of mass motion, and the evaporation of the impactor are examined. The properties of the shock-heated gas are calculated and analyzed. It is observed that the mass of atmospheric gas driven off into space by an impact is proportional to the mass of atmospheric gas encountered by the impactor.},
